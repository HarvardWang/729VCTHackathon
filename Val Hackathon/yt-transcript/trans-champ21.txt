hello we are joined with by Sentinels who 
are coming off of their match against EDG  
we'll begin with remote media and then move 
to the in-person questions we'll take the  
first question from Andre from pra Esports hi 
good afternoon guys my name is Andre from BR  
Esports I want to start to by giving you all 
my super I know it's hard to come here after  
a defeat but a defeat is always an opportunity 
to learn how come back stronger there are many  
fans who support you who made You Jump 
for when you defeated Genji and went to  
playoff do you have any message for them so 
they won't be so worried and sad after this
defeat I mean we always show we come back better 
after losses so thank you guys for the support  
and you know I know we're playing fanatic 
so uh it'll be interesting but yeah thank  
you guys for the support we appreciate it and 
uh we'll make sure we uh we work hard tonight  
to be ready for tomorrow thank you we'll take 
the next question from Fernando from game arena  
uh thank you hi guys my name is Fernando from 
game arena Brazil my question is for Sassi s
thank you we'll take the next 
question from Pedro Romero
hey guys likewise unfortunate on how the series 
played out and likewise hopefully you guys can  
bounce back in the next one uh got a got a 
question to to Kaplan I'm going to head over  
to the third map in Sunset obviously it's been a 
map that the team has been known for being strong  
in for the entire year uh obviously I didn't go 
out the way you guys had wanted just want to ask  
you what was the biggest issue that affected 
the team in that final uh map in both halves  
uh from your point of view I don't um I don't 
think we came back into map three with the kind  
of confidence and resolve and faith in ourselves 
that we needed to in order to bounce back and it  
just took way way way too long to get that going 
in fact it only really showed up once the game was  
all but over and there was no pressure anymore 
so just needed to go into map three after map  
to having reset and found ourselves again and we 
just didn't so makes it really hard to win the map  
thank you we'll take the next question from
Solera hello guys considerations on your 
loss I'm sure you can bounce back I have  
two questions my first question is to J QT 
on lot this map after the first six rounds  
it seemed that um adg like uh has changed 
their pace of attack back and after that  
it seemed like it was like harder for react 
to react for you uh can you comment on that
please uh I mean they didn't do anything that 
we didn't expect I think we I think we were in  
a good positions we just uh misplayed a bit on 
the post plants and like like not playing for  
the retakes like not playing for the right 
win conditions so yeah I think we just uh  
misplayed overall the second half of Defense 
with the like kind of like the mid round and  
like PLS mid round thank you and my second 
question is to zelus um poster yesterday was  
talking a lot about how he wants to meet you in 
the next round uh he also said that um he wants  
to take you down but if you take them down then 
he thinks that you deserve to win it all so I  
would like to hear your comment uh about your 
next face off thank you yeah I mean he really  
makes that small look like a medium doesn't he 
a big boy huh um I saw boser said I was hoping  
to win this game and be able to give something 
more perky answer back to him but uh it's going  
to be a good match either of way fanatic I 
mean I think I think both teams look about  
the same um in terms of everything um I think 
we have the edge because boser averages five  
kills this tournament so should be a should 
be a fun game that's M up man really looking  
forward to your next match and good luck thank 
you thank you well take the next question from
ravish hey guys uh tough day today unfortunally 
uh now uh my question is going to go over to kapl  
uh Hey cap uh you hey don't uh probably not great 
but you uh you talked to it or just right in the  
me interview talked to about how the breaks would 
be nice 5 days but you know four days isn't too  
bad though so uh I was get a bit of your minds 
I'm going and after today there's just a prep  
going on just make sure you're not too hagger for 
tomorrow I can look forward to rest of the games  
and just just yeah overall just give me your 
mindset going into tonight hope Tor what's up  
man have your thoughts yeah um we're going to 
go back and talk as a team and watch our game  
hopefully with comms back as a team and going to 
be a night where we focus on ourselves right I  
mean definitely probably a very long night after 
that for Drew and I to try to prepare as well as  
we can but bottom line we lost to ourselves so we 
got to make sure we're not doing that tomorrow so  
gotcha yeah g to be a very long night and a long 
morning and not a lot of sleep but it is what it  
is let how tournaments go cheers thanks man yeah 
thanks thank you we'll take the next question from
Sierra yeah uh first off commiserations on 
the loss um my question is for tens um you  
just twed after the game that it took 
you a long time to wake up from kind of  
an in-game coma and I just wanted to know 
kind of uh when you think you guys started  
into that mental and what were the major 
causes of It kind of after of map one uh I  
definitely think it happened somewhere around 
Lotus when we were giving up the lead um felt  
a bit hard for us to bounce back it's hard to 
pinpoint what exactly the issue was we're going  
to review everything tonight and make sure it 
doesn't happen again thank you we'll take the  
next question from Fon oh hello can you guys hear 
me yes okay uh so my question is for everyone uh  
how do you guys see the China's region involving 
in the F and champions tournament yeah thank
you can answer I feel like China they are 
growing they're like uh they always they're  
always considered like as as underdogs and I can 
talk about this because back in loud playing the  
Brazilian team kind of felt the same and I 
don't know me myself talking about myself I  
obviously like China is a danger because they 
have a lot of uh growth potential and I think  
they're doing a pretty good job thisor especially 
EDG and yeah that's it okay thank you how about
t um I think they have a lot of talented 
players within the China region and I I think  
strategically um in previous years they were 
lacking but definitely you've seen Improvement  
year by year uh to the point now that like 
they were playing really well against us um  
and working on okay thank you guys good luck 
thank you we'll take the next question from
sidarth uh hello guys conversations on the loss um 
I'd like to ask this question to either Kaplan or  
John QT uh on Sunset we obviously saw a pretty 
rough defense off 210 but we saw some glimp uh  
glimmers of Hope for Sentinels on the attack site 
where you guys are very favored so do you think  
the outcome of the match or the map could have 
gone much more differently if he started on the  
attack side I don't I think that we had a major 
lack of confidence and belief in ourselves going  
into the map and so we had a terrible defense half 
and I think it's easier to have more confidence  
when it starts to feel like there's nothing on 
the line because there it's just so hard to to  
mount a comeback that you just feel like you have 
nothing to lose and obviously in those situations  
you see it all the time teams can come back but 
to me we went in with no confidence in the first  
half of the game regardless what half it was 
and we started to bounce back because there  
was no feeling of pressure anymore because of the 
score line uh especially after losing the pistol  
on attack all right thank you and good luck with 
this fanatic thank you we'll go next to Andre hi  
my question is for Sassi this time we all know 
that you and aspas are very good friends he gave  
his all to be able to take you to Champions so 
we do you the same to be able to cross paths  
with him in the lower bracket or in the final I 
hope it's in the final I'm not going to wish he  
go the lower yeah I'll be Che for them for sure 
thank you so much thank you we'll go next to
stfi hi I'm saiki this question is 
for everyone despite today's defeat  
is there anything positive you can 
take away from this match thank you
uh I mean something positive obviously the 
first map I think we played a great Haven and  
uh a great first half of defense for Lotus 
but there's still a lot to fix on it and I  
think how we kind of ended the sunset on attack 
like trying to do a comeback I think we were in  
a in a good uh headit space even though we 
still did mistakes and we just need to like  
gather the energy that we had at the end and 
just take it for tomorrow we'll go next to
rabish hey guys uh back again quick uh so on a 
lighter note uh my question uh second up is to  
Zack uh hey Zack uh uh real quick so I want to 
talk a bit more about your NE because although  
you know although was tough day in general 
the movement I want I want to point out looked  
Immaculate could you talk to me bit about like the 
drills you've been doing how youve been practicing  
that the slid look crazy out there bro what's 
going on with that I just play a lot of team  
death match with neon and just like jump around 
with her but I like characters that have like cool  
Movement Like reay's got her satchels neon's got 
her like running and sliding so it's just a lot  
of fun for me to like play in my free time and I 
just keep getting better at it makes sense is it  
also because she's Filipina too yeah pretty much 
yeah I knew it thanks thank you we'll take the  
final two questions uh first Sierra yeah I also 
have a question for second that's a little bit  
lighter on the note of movement uh your mom during 
one of the halftime interviews she know busted a  
move and showed off their moves during uh during 
that interview um did you know she could dance  
like that did you see it from stage and you know 
maybe if you could choose another valerant parent  
to like face off in a dance battle against your 
mom who would it be and why um I didn't get the  
chance to see it but knowing her it was probably 
it was probably a good it was gandom style I think  
yeah it sounds like yeah um she likes 
to dance if I had to pick another Val  
parent to have a dance battle her um 
maybe like mamom I just think it'd be  
fun but but thanks thank you cheers and 
we'll take the final question from Pedro
Romero got a question for John ke or anyone 
else I would like to answer if they want to  
chip in uh I want to ask for your thoughts on 
just facing EDG in general given that obviously  
the result came out as it did today 
what was the biggest challenge that  
EDG threw upon you and and the 
rest of the team um collectively
speaking uh I mean we started EDG they didn't 
really do anything that like surpris us overall  
uh I just think when they started like winning 
rounds and they got a lot of confidence we kind  
of lacked in that regard and kept like it was kind 
of like a Snowball Effect and they kept getting  
confident they kep going for uh aggro Peaks and 
like I mean they were just playing to win and we  
we're like playing not to lose and I mean yeah I 
mean when they when they have the momentum going  
for them they're a great team and we messed up 
and dropped the ball and that's something we  
have to learn and move on with it Sentinels thank 
you so much for taking the time to speak with us  
today we'll be back with the next team in a few 
moments thank you thank you thank you thank you
