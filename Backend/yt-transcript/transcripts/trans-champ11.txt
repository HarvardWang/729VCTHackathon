okay we are ready uh welcome back everyone 
for the next segment we have here Sentinels  
uh congratulations guys for your Victory today uh 
now we are going to open to uh some question from  
the media on the call so please raise your hand 
and I will call on you we are going to start with  
Brandon from Esports GG thank you very much 
congrats on the win guys um I'll ask this for  
really whoever wants to give their input you know 
we saw an interview during the game with Rob Moore  
this CEO of Sentinels here uh with him being 
in Korea I just like to ask kind of what are  
your guys' relationship with him and you know 
how important is it to have that CEO that's so  
uh proud of of where you guys are and you know 
what kind of uh impact has he made being here  
in Korea with you guys H uh I'm terrified of the 
guy personally he came here and said if we lost  
we'd have to swim home so I guess it's extra 
motivation but like I'm I'm scared of the man  
sh for the extra motivation yeah it's a lot of fun 
to have an owner that's so passionate invested in  
b e sports like even when we're just hanging out 
like on the LA grind I'll come in in the morning  
to prep and sometimes he'll come in and be like 
did you watch the car Carmine versus fanatic game  
and sometimes I'm like no I didn't and then my 
owner's like well this is what happened in map two  
this is what happened in map three and it's just 
I I think it's a lot of fun yeah for sure very
passionate oh thank you for your 
announ next question is from
Pomo hey guys likewise congrat yes can You' 
hear me okay yeah y can hear me um hey guys  
congrats on the W moving on to playoffs 
in Champions uh a major achievement for  
this team given the road that you guys have took 
since Madrid that said I'm going to direct the  
question towards T I asked you similar I asked 
you uh um just sort of your Reflections on 2020  
won to now um earlier on before the start of 
this event now that you've kind of G through  
the glass ceiling I would say of the group 
stage in Champions uh for this year how how  
how good does that most feel for you and also 
for the rest of the team to make that happen uh  
alongside you yeah definitely feels amazing I 
mean we wouldn't be we wouldn't have won if we  
didn't play our best as a team individually um 
so I'm just really proud of everyone for that  
uh it's definitely been an awesome Journey 
just in this entire year especially um I I  
definitely feel like we're we're coming back 
up with our confidence and it feels really
nice thank you so much uh next question
for yeah hello uh congratulations on the victory 
my question is for Kaplan um you took a timeout  
before the last round during that first half on 
Lotus which to some is a bit unorthodox since  
you get to talk with the team during halftime 
regardless was that simply because you kind of  
were at risk of going 66 on an attack side of map 
like Lotus or what made you feel like you needed  
to pause and talk with the team at that moment in 
particular uh I I definitely very rarely do that  
because I prefer even though sometimes I come into 
timeouts with strats I like to also timeout where  
you can talk about multiple rounds upcoming 
and help with the Vibes and stuff like that  
um I was hesitant at first I feel like I've 
been holding timeouts on attack a lot because  
we've had hard defenses lately and I think part 
of being confident is acting confident and that  
goes for my timeouts too uh there were a bunch 
of alts on the board I had a call in my own mind  
I was excited about and it's you know it's hard 
to play around a bunch of vaults yeah I thought  
why not get one more round than I Believe in 
Us on defense and you know I think we have a  
good plan going into defense I still have 
another timeout for defense and obviously  
if defense goes our way going to call timeouts 
which helps us too so uh glad I did it and I I  
think everyone worked really hard together on 
the timeout to make sure we got the round out  
of it the first thing you said was I want the 
seven yeah yeah yeah actually didn't remember
that thank you for your answer 
next question is from Pomo
okay I'm here I'm here I'm here uh sorry about 
that just had my mic muted accidentally um  
getting back to the point um I'm going to direct 
this question more so towards um Kaplan and Sassi  
over an ice box you know we seen a return to the 
old familiar composition in that map uh and in  
addition to that you guys made a little bit of 
a of a SL a slight change in set composition  
bringing back s These Old Reliable that being SOA 
in for the Geto I want to ask you just sort of um  
what was the game plan behind making that change 
happen and how how successful that game plan  
played out uh uh in elaboration so to speak uh 
I can go first I guess yeah uh I mean we did not  
have a lot of time to piece a ice box together and 
honestly I think we were all on the same page that  
we have a incredible like world class proven SOA 
player who's been very comfortable on the agent  
for a very long time and I think we're all of the 
same opinion that it's a bit of an easier comp to  
pil it to than gecko so when we're trying to piece 
something together with very little prep time it  
just made sense right yeah we kind of predict 
um B an ice box because with Ben aen and when  
we went to ice box honestly was like no pressure 
at all you know it's gen they're they just won  
Masters it's their pick so we figured out like 
why don't we play like with comfortable comps  
everyone feel comfortable playing the game so we 
went there on the second map even if it was one  
Zer we we still felt like was z z and didn't feel 
pressure at all and yeah just played silver it's
classic thank you so much uh please 
uh just remember to everyone in the  
call please don't your hand after asking 
questions uh so in that way we can have  
the opportunity for more people in the 
call so next question is from Antonio
summer thank you so much hi I Amon Summer from 
narud my question is for Yun this year this is  
your first year with Sentinels as egl you w a 
master had some had some setbacks during the  
regular season but still qualified for Champions 
and and made it to the playoffs how do you feel  
about this great year you have uh I feel good 
definitely blessed to have such a good first  
year as a tier one RL and uh I mean the year is 
not done yet obviously the goal is to win champ  
so I'm not thinking much about how my year went 
I'm just glad to be here and glad to be still  
competing at this time and obviously with the 
bunch of great teammates and everyone in the  
staff and the story continues and we we going 
to playoff it will just win CHS next and then  
I can reflect on the year thank you so much 
and congratulations thank you thank you next  
question is from Lucas B hello everyone I'm 
Lucas from spot.net congrats the my question
for for
play
play thank you uh next question is from
ravish sweet uh thanks guys uh firstly congrats 
again on the win absolutely massive dub let's  
go bro uh so my question is for Sashi uh my ball 
brother in Christ what possessed you today on Ice  
boox bro just like I got to know you dropping 
like you know 215 ACS man you look incredible  
out there the soo looks good right now what's 
going on honestly I don't know uh I don't know  
it was just natural I guess you know I wasn't 
comfortable agent and our team like I felt like  
the environment was really comfortable so I 
could focus more on myself as well and I'll  
be honest winning four pieces and four bonus 
make life way easier so yeah I think was just  
natural just was just flowing the game I imagine 
so all right congrats again let's go and good luck  
in playoffs thank you thanks for be thank you 
thanks Zach thank you uh next question is from
s hi uh thank you I'm SN from Sports 
K Esports my question is for Kaplan so  
just wanted to know in general what according 
to you was the overall Difference Maker today  
within your team as opposed to that first 
match against jeni that led to the dominant  
win it's the same Difference Maker between our 
fpx game and our first geni game we showed up  
everyone everyone showed up in terms of being 
a teammate like every single player on this  
team was speaking to each other when they 
were frustrated they were sharing it when  
things needed to change when we need to make 
plans when when we needed to make ideas like  
everything we were just flowing and being creative 
and working together and when we weren't people  
were holding each other accountable on that 
and that seems to be the secret ingredient to  
us winning thank you so much and congrats on 
the win thank you thank you next question is  
from Julia Katarina hi guys congratulations 
onene and my question goes to Sassi well
s fore
thank you so much uh again we have another 
queue for more questions next question is
from yeah um I have two short silly questions for 
the Merchant himself zelis uh first off you to be  
a new flag on stage and I was curious you know 
do you have those all packed in your suitcase  
like do how many more you got are they getting 
printed on the Fly Like especially since you're  
going into playoffs now uh a wise person once told 
me that Paris Hilton once changed her shirt like  
a hundred times to get new Paparazzi pictures of 
her back to back and now it's stuck with me so I  
think uh you know as many flags as I can bring out 
I'll start doing that and hopefully keep sing send  
bundles great what are you waffling about and then 
the second funny question is if you win Champs are  
you going to pose with the Champions Trophy like 
you did during the games today like with the spray  
like with your hand above your head oh my gosh I 
have a new motivation cuz then maybe you drop you  
well they put my spray in the game like I'm like 
would not let me tell a secret it's too heavy it's  
heavy yeah you can dude I've been doing curls 
bro I've been doing curls what if we win Champs  
and get Paris Hilton oh my God proot the bundle 
I want Faker to promote the bundle my Faker if  
you hear this or read this I want you to promote 
this un bundle it when I'm in the grand finals of  
Champions thanks con congrats and good luck in 
playoffs of course thank you uh next question  
is from Brandon awesome thanks again Brandon from 
Esports GG this one's also to zelis it was a kind  
of a close Scrappy round we saw the mics pick 
up afterwards where he said it doesn't matter  
how we did it it's that we did it I just like to 
kind of get your expansion on that philosophy you  
know it's kind of been a rough time you know this 
year in some points but also a successful time at  
some points so just how is that kind of philosophy 
about how the road doesn't really matter but the  
destination does uh how is that kind of helped 
you guys keep your composure throughout the year  
uh I mean it's valerant right so like any anything 
can really happen even in life like anything can  
happen things you can't control so like as long 
as you do it it's you know it's that you did it  
it doesn't matter how you did it it's that you did 
obviously you can go back and you know watch vods  
you can you know think about different choices 
you made or whatever the case may be but as long  
as you do it it's that you did it wow you're 
inspirational bro also all these like cringe  
things I'm saying I I see all you guys quoting 
me by the way okay I'm crazy I understand I'm  
gonna keep doing it thank you for the question 
thank you okay next question is from better
uh I want to ask this question to anyone in the 
team that would like to answer um seeing you guys  
you know um be laughing all all jokes and stuff 
pretty good to see reminiscent I would say from  
what happened in Madrid that said how do you 
kind of look at the team's current form as it  
is right now getting into playoffs in Champions 
compared to how it was back in Madrid when you  
guys won the whole thing so how do you kind of 
compare that and where do you kind of see the  
the the space SL margin slash gap between those 
two um time frames for for you in your point of
view who wants to can answer everyone yeah um 
honestly I don't feel that it's a gap between  
the teams I feel like any teams can beat 
anyone you're right now uh I think Tracy  
Sports is uh proof they're in playoffs right 
now and everything's hard oh are you trying to  
say they're bad bro no and we just beat 
gen G so yeah champs is hard I know it  
and it's going to be hard not going 
to be easy and that's it there's no
gaps thank you so much uh next question is from
Sid uh hello congrats on the win uh I'd like to 
ask this question to Zen on ice box in the first  
half uh we saw you holding the bide quite often 
and J just kept hitting the a side for lot of  
the rounds and then the one round you went to B 
uh a they went and attacked the B side so how do  
it just feel being uh playing retake Simulator 
for the whole defense off of ice books uh let  
me tell you I was having so much fun like I just I 
just really love staring at the same angle for the  
entire round and then they go to the other other 
site it's just nothing I love more in the game  
than that but I mean yeah it was kind of boring 
but we we had a we had a good half regardless I  
I held my space so I did my job at least but uh 
yeah it was kind of boring all right uh congrats  
on the win again and good luck in the playoffs 
thank you last question in the call is from
rabish I this all right I got to come back yay uh 
so real quick uh my question is to Jordan uh now  
uh zus we talked 48 hours ago about you you you 
said something specific you said I mean as good  
as gen are is GNA feel incredible to send them 
home now is that Elation still the exact same  
that that that when you told me that well now 
I kind of feel bad so I've decided to donate  
$ th dollar to the worldlife community for 
Tigers going extinct so that's all I have to
say respect man thanks man okay uh thanks so 
much now we have uh some question here in the  
room so so hi my name is so VR my first part of 
the question is for S not really the question  
but the first part is for sassy first off I 
interview you day one you said at the very  
end that I would like to see you again when 
you actually win and go to playoffs and here  
you are now so good job on that and then the 
second part of this is for anyone who like to  
answer so heading into Champions I think after 
you kind of bombed out in VCT americaas there  
was really a lack of faith from fans from haters 
in the team especially even less after you guys  
got to get after you guys got a you kind of got 
put in the group of death you were like the last  
team that people were kind of expecting to go 
through but now you've qualified the playoffs  
as the second seed so how does it kind of feel 
to shut up the haters and kind of get your form  
back after VCT Americas are you going to 
answer the first part first I said thank  
you oh oh can I answer the second part yeah 
listen everyone voted for us to be overrated  
look at us now we've taken your Gods down you have 
anything to say to the VR forums no bunch of bums

put you on the spot this this is uh Jacob from  
capitals esports.com this question for the whole 
team uh coming into this Sentinel was settled with  
the moniker most overrated team in the tournament 
now that you've uh removed the top rated team geni  
in convincing 20 fashion do you have any anything 
to say to the faithless doubters Jacob I love you  
well we are the richest most clouded handsomest 
team in Oregon the business so it's only natural  
that everyone hates us because they want to be us 
so you know shut up or we run deadlock again shut  
up just shut up or we run deadlock for every map 
that there's more than three hateful form threats  
okay thank you thank you Jacob thank you uh we 
have another yeah last question K room okay yeah
hello guys and congrats with the win so my 
question is about playoffs since ji is out which  
team do you want to face the most uh and which 
team do you consider your bigest rival now thank
you guys want to go down like the line we 
have like a list first go Jesus Christ who  
do you want to play this is bad fortune um 
I don't think we have about rival honestly  
just like we don't care and um I hope we play 
against Leviton I think it's going to be fun I  
hope they qualify they still got to qualify 
brother I mean I hope they qualify can I can  
I answer and you guys shut up they're second 
seed we can't get them so what we win they win  
we met them they make it okay I mean I trust 
osas okay that's it okay John what about you
thean Theon and we'll actually I'm not going to 
say the same part I was going to say something

hard thethan they're the ones that put us here
