we'll begin with the remote media and then 
move to um the in-person questions uh we'll  
take the first question from Sports K yes uh 
first of all commiserations on the loss guys  
my question is for Valen so I wanted to know 
how it was for you as the igl to call shots  
against Heretics that just continued to win 
out every duel and just seemed to be ready for
everything say um um the game plan never really 
changes no matter what even if they're hitting  
more shots like they were on fire today we 
could definitely feel it in the server in  
terms of game plan or how I call everything 
kind of stays the same maybe you want to  
play a bit more packed up just because they're 
hitting the individual shots so you got to try  
to get the trades going more play more like less 
spread maybe a bit more obvious but you're more  
together is one approach um and just being more 
explosive to try to counteract their you know  
their shots but I would say we tried to 
do that today and we were successful at  
points but they were able to outlast us and 
yeah honestly that's about it they were just  
able to outlast us like we had our key moments 
we had our chances but when it came down to  
maybe the 2v2 33s they were able to close more 
they were clutching more so I would say their  
their momentum throughout the last series 
and shots today were just kind of too much  
for us today thank you and we hope to see you in 
Champions uh thank you we'll go next to nerditude
hi thank you um first of all I'm sorry about 
the defeat but I know you will make it to the  
Champions uh my question is for Josh what do you 
think was the reason for the overwhelming defeat
um there's more many reasons I think they 
were uh the better team today for sure they  
were individually on form and they were 
hitting a lot of their shots um and we  
didn't do too much in the micro sense to trade 
the kills very well so even though we were in  
advantage and positioned really well um I would 
say like we couldn't we couldn't trade out like  
certain key players and they were able to multif 
frag us um but yeah like I feel like the moment  
that they were building up and uh like we're a 
slow start team right now we just need to fix  
that and uh it would have G given us a chance 
thing um but honestly they were just a better  
team today and I hope that we can rematch them 
again thank you so much we'll go next to strafe  
e Sports commiseration on the L guys this is 
to Valen and Josh uh despite the loss today  
you have had an amazing journey you who delivered 
multiple upsets came back from from a 211 deficit  
to reach your place like this is your highest is 
highest for everyone on the table uh uh first of  
all how was the experience like for you guys and 
what how what would the learnings and experience  
be helpful to you in the upcoming upcoming 
split how would you use it for the upcoming
split um this experience for me was definitely 
like uh it's hard to put into a words just  
because I always dreamed of like playing in 
front of this type of crowd you know like  
watching matches growing up and always dreaming 
of being a pro and then becoming one and trying  
to grind your way to the top uh to be able to 
play in these kind of Arenas you know regardless  
of these losses today I've I'm very grateful for 
the experience that I got just because it makes it  
feel so rewarding like even though it was losses 
you know of course I would want to win right but  
no not many people in their life can say they 
can experience something like this even in the  
pros so very grateful um in terms of learning 
I think that we shown that we can be great um  
individuals and as a team we shown that we can 
deliver the biggest comebacks um the best of  
wins even when no one expects us to win but they 
were like other teams were able to outlast Us in  
the tournament and so I think we need to have our 
habits down a bit more like so we stopped these  
slow starts for example we kind of showed that 
in this tournament if we had it very habitual  
of how we want to approach these rounds approach 
the game like we wouldn't have to try to ramp up  
during the game we would just go into it right 
away delivering the 100% and that was a hole  
in this tournament that we couldn't fix enough to 
become Champions um regardless I'm grateful to do  
it with the best people around me um I wouldn't 
want it to do it with anyone else and thank you  
Shanghai thank you everyone for making my dreams 
come true thank you so much great answer amazing  
thank you our next question was submitted 
uh by the circles Thailand um a question  
to ask the G2 team does your online content 
from social media put additional pressure on
you no not really I think it kind of makes like 
backlash a little worse but um I mean that's just  
part of like Esports and just being professional 
is of what we do um it's a competitive you know  
um game so I don't think it adds the extra 
pressure um some of the stuff is a little like  
stupid I'll be honest but I I it's fun yeah like 
the last thing we're thinking about when we're  
down 06 is like oh my God YouTu tweeted we're 
gonna beat them today like we're not thinking  
about that it's just it's just entertainment for 
the fans and you know uh and if I was a fan I I  
would like that too I would like you know little 
like trolls and beast on Twitter or I think it's  
thank you we'll go next to Pedro
Romero hey guys likewise commiserations on the 
on the law today uh going down it's always a  
tough thing to go through but it was one that 
happened very late in in the tournament and you  
know talking about that uh not many people 
would expect this team to go so far finish  
third and Outlast the other na teams teams 
that people looked at as as contenders all  
the while but um my question goes to to anyone 
that would like to ask uh for this team to go  
so far play so well um Outlast the other 
two na uh America's teams um what do you  
think just helped this team just spark this 
run and just play so well and just go so far
I've been I've been preaching this message 
throughout this tournament um since our run  
in the playoffs in the Americas that we're 
here for each other we're supporting each  
other always and it reflects in our team play 
um we were touted as like a team that's like  
highly disciplined don't throw away advantages we 
know how to like Brien out rounds and uh build up  
like a mental resiliency out out of it um and 
that's just kind of the approach I felt like  
that is a more consistent approach shutting 
down like Star duelist teams are kind of like  
high investment into a certain player like 
we can shut them down um and so I personally  
like that brand of valerant myself and the boys 
embody it they love it and I try to have like a  
sort of culture outside of the team or outside 
of the game to also reflect that so a lot of the  
stuff we do here like we're always together you 
know um we're enjoying the city taking walks and  
all that you know it's it's been a very it's 
been a very like good good tournament for us  
for us to grow in so um there no real secret 
really thank you we'll next go to nerditude
hi again ER my my question is for iy I see how 
do you feel after your first experience in a  
master and getting such a great results yeah 
I'm grateful for the opportunity you know sh  
has been amazing the fans have been great I'm 
grateful for the team surrounding me you know  
our coaching staff everybody that's a part of 
our team just made made this uh made this all  
so great and I think our run was you know I think 
inspiring for up toing players but you know other  
teams I think what we did is something great 
and obviously I wish we could have capitalized  
on the opportunity given to us playing in this 
big stage and came out with wins especially in  
this one today go to the Grand finals but 
I think regardless I'm proud of my team and  
yeah thank you so much thank you are there 
any other questions for G2 either from the  
room or the remote media G2 thank you so much for 
taking the time to speak with us today thank you
