hi everybody we are joined by fanatic who are  
coming off of their match against gen 
uh we'll begin with questions from the  
remote media and then move to onsite 
media uh Robia would you like to start
us um hello everyone uh so sorry for the 
loss today but it was a great match um  
my question is from Boer but anyone can 
answer um on Bree today um you guys had  
better defensive p with Cipher there but 
while you had great lead on attack um the  
same storyline didn't continue on defense 
um can you share what exactly went wrong
there oh yeah you can talk then I we did good 
great job entries and B Co was really good but  
don't defense we struggle a bit and because 
I think I mean we can fix this kind of things  
hard to play and some we know what do 
but we can't react like that's why we  
stuck in the game what Happ yeah thank 
you so much and good luck for the next
match uh this is to coach coach El and 
poer uh today you lost four out of the  
six pist rounds do you think that 
impacted the outcome of the game
I yeah you want to be winning as many of them as 
possible something I think we can improve on it's  
not been our strongest thing all year I mean 
pist rounds are ridiculously important in this  
game yeah can I ask a followup question go ahead 
uh also there were so many rounds where fnatic  
had an advantage especially on Lotus and even 
sometimes on some rounds on bind but jji brought  
it really close and also even closed out some of 
the rounds what do you think the problem has been  
in such rounds where you have the advantage but 
JIS is somehow shot better and close it out for  
you before you I mean they're so situational I 
mean some of them we we can do a better grouping  
up I think that on we have a man Advantage we need 
to make sure we're tradable um and other ones are  
just messy it kind of looked like a man Advantage 
but they put us in an awkward spot because they  
creating a lot of lot of chaos they a lot of their 
nice set strategies but yeah I think we can we you  
always do a better job of grouping up those man 
advantages it's just if you have the man Advantage  
if you can trade out then then you'll win so we 
just got to make sure we're doing that yeah thank
you thank you we'll go next to uh Sports K yes 
uh first of all conversations on the loss uh  
my question is to Boer so today's series 
had a lot of ups and downs for both teams  
but despite the despite the narrow loss today 
I wanted to know if there are any positives  
that you happy about from today's series um I 
think the positive is that we could have won um  
and I think we should have won uh so the positive 
is that in the lower bracket run we just got to  
grind out and if we play them again I think we're 
going to beat them because today I think we played  
really well until we didn't play really well so 
yeah I think we we weren't we wer we weren't I  
guess what the word is like we weren't in the Flow 
State in terms of reading what was going on what  
was abusing us on defense and we weren't trying 
or taking risks or anything we were kind of doing  
our bits and Bobs and just getting caught with our 
pants down so yeah I think hopefully now from this  
tournament from this game on it was first game 
on the stage so now we've got the first game out  
the way I think it's hopefully going to be a lot 
nicer process for us and we can all just relax and  
start winning thank you and good luck on your next 
match thank you very much we'll go next to Pedro
Romero hey guys likewise commiserations on 
the series um you know given the result of  
the draft you guys ended up with geni 
SLS team to be picked um just want to  
know what was your guys' reaction like and 
also what was the preparation like in terms  
of just trying to find ways to defeat them 
and and any and anything else of the like
yeah I mean I mean actually we want to play 
with JJ actually we was talking about before  
we pick like before we it left and I want 
to say the team guys I want to play with  
the most strongest team because I don't 
want to start with weak team I just want  
to play with ji and if he win we win 
tournament but we lost today I think  
we learn we're going to learn much things 
because we could have win so easy yeah
thank you we'll go next to clutch
points hello um this is a question for 
the team uh this is the first match for  
fanatic back in the international stage after 
missing Madrid and with the loss today uh was  
it on this on stage Jitters coming back 
or did geni just simply outperform you
guys uh I don't know that was just few things 
going on sides like land what yeah we haven't  
played for a long time but I think everyone was 
hungry for it and uh kind like excited to play  
but we had some issues like right before the 
game and then also during the game we were a  
bit stressed and like G played good so I don't 
think it's really us being nervous for land or  
getting D it's just they played good and we 
had a bit of situation that also impacted
us thank you we'll go next to Sons of
chos hello everyone uh commiss hell to day guys 
my question is for bolster uh moving uh looking  
ahead in the tournament what areas of this match 
you think that were good uh even in the defit like  
uh for your team the Synergy the communication 
the aim uh the mechanics what are those like  
positive things that you take from this match 
I think uh everyone here had a round that was  
uh very good so I think it's just we have the we 
have the potential we have the Firepower we have  
the strategy it's just I think the last thing 
is um is just maintaining the risk factor I'd  
say um and being able to take the reads I think 
the reason why like you might think paperex is  
good I think is because they read what's going on 
in front of them and then adapt to it and I think  
if we can if we can do that a bit more and like 
you know we we're getting abused on B let's put  
some more resources on B on Breeze uh instead of 
like trying to play a or something you know so I  
think we have what it takes we have everything 
there it's just the last piece of the puzzle I  
think and then yeah we'll win thank you good 
luck in the upcoming matches we'll go to Will  
from G Su Gamers next hi I just want to check 
with you guys how does it feel to face foot  
again on the international stage it is boring 
because whenever I I go to World Cup I'm just  
saying I don't want to play with em teams like we 
already played three times and we playing again  
like it's just boring for me and I and I need to 
show again I think who is the best cish player all  
right good luck thank you uh we'll go to strafe 
next yeah uh this is just uh check up on uh Leo  
is he is he fine now as the health concerns over 
anyone's free to answer yeah he's fine yeah thank
you and we'll go to Pedro then for the last remote
question um question goes to Boler you already 
mentioned a little bit about just the team's  
mindset um taking having takeaways from this 
series and then looking a little bit ahead to  
the Future and a little bit of thoughts on um from 
alpha here as well um about food but still um for  
you in particular what's the mindset like going 
to be like for you to try to uh orchestrate a deep  
lower bracket run not that you guys are dropped 
down in the first obstacle to the lower bracket  
so yeah biggest adjustments for you uh in leading 
the team for the road ahead for me it's like the  
sooner we can reset so as soon as we get back we 
got to reset and get back on on the grind we're  
not out of the tournament and if you want to go 
to the Mercedes-Benz Arena and play in front of  
the big Chinese fan base then this is this is 
it you we've come all this way and to to lose  
now in a in a in a rubbish fashion is not what I 
signed up for um and and I want to stay in it for  
the long one run and I want to win the trophy so 
I'd say just you got to maintain positive you know  
keep the energy up there we're not out of the 
tournament and like when we get back into that  
room it's no mess around it's it's full into full 
Focus fix what's going wrong and let's go into the  
game because we were we were definitely shooting 
I think it was just we weren't thinking so I think  
if we start thinking and start doing what our 
kind of win conditions are we'll win the game  
um yeah and then it's just lower bracket grind so 
it looks like people are going to be seeing Sunset  
again if we make it to the final uh yeah thank 
you and I think we had some questions in the room
this question is goes for booler so how do 
you feel about this Arena and the vibe or  
something and also to hear the chers from all 
of the crowds I was going to say the the arena  
is uh it the stage looks awesome you know 
you and they've added like the LEDs on the  
side with like our faces and stuff that's kind 
of a cool touch but the crowd is so loud like  
when we were backstage uh we could hear them 
all kind of like cheering and getting ready  
and and I was was talking to Alfie I was like 
oh my goodness my I haven't like had the the  
adrenaline the excitement for well this whole 
year normally when we go on EMA I don't really  
have that kind of like oh here we go but for 
some reason here today it was like oh I was  
getting really excited um and yeah it's probably 
why I started off pretty rough as well because I  
was like I need to calm down I couldn't think 
so um yeah I think I think it was yeah it was  
really cool the crowd were super loud for 
both teams I think and it was a it was an  
exciting game that's why I want to get to the 
I was going swear that's why I want to get to  
the flipping next Arena I want to hear that next 
MCH thank you are there any more questions in the
room natic thank you so much for 
taking your time to speak with us today
