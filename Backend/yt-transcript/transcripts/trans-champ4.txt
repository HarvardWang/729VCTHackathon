oh yeah it's me again um so uh I have one more 
question and it's about DRX so you will be facing  
them in the next match so I was curious uh what 
they think about your opponent and maybe there  
are like specific traits or like uh some players 
from DRX that you would like to point out thank
you is it for hero it's for anyone I think can 
I can yes yes it's for anyone thank you when we  
played with DRX last time it was 2022 Champions 
I guess we played them last we played at least  
twice I don't remember then remember chamber I 
remembered only one game is 2022 Champions because  
they eliminated us and it was my own country oh I 
see and I was waiting this moment actually what is  
going on bro here we are yeah you can continue 
yeah we beat them but not in South Korea yeah  
I'm going to beat them their own country 
I'm I'm kind of sad because I can't send  
their home I can send them in lower but we will 
see in playoffs M it's actually a good idea but  
the thing is we already eliminated them in the 
next Champs and after that we eliminated them  
on the Red Bull home ground bro but we didn't 
eliminate them in Korea that's fine bro let's  
do that now then it's not fine there you have it 
um for me is ma is recently an igl as so looking  
forward to seeing what he's been cooking up on the 
mid rounds um and see if it's going to be a fun
game thank you thank you so much uh last 
question is from Arab hey guys congrats on  
the win uh my question is actually open for 
everyone uh I want to take back at the start  
of the season when Elma joined and there were 
a lot of criticism around him uh from then to  
now uh Champions uh qualifying for Champions 
winning stage two uh the team has changed a  
lot what do you think uh uh you guys learned 
majorly uh from Elma as a coach uh after um  
after transition from mini and uh can you give 
me a small like uh process throughout the season  
what uh what you guys learned the 
most um am I going again okay I can go
on okay I mean Elma has a kind of like different 
approach to minia so in when he came in it was  
like very clear that he wanted to us to kind of 
like work together and solve problems together  
and kind of like work on uh macro side so like 
the players can fix it because mini was like  
like uh with Bost like a coach who was trying 
to fix everything through Jake and now like we  
have many as a assistant coach still kind of 
like helping Jake a lot while Elma is like uh  
just doing the fall macro getting guys to work 
together like solve problems after like day ends  
and stuff uh to fix stuff so of course he had he 
had a lot of criticism this like fall season but  
for me like in when he came in I knew like he's 
a good coach he he had a lot of experience maybe  
a lot of people don't know but also like it was 
very clear that he's good especially when we on  
like stage one stage two and still like uh like 
that kind of confirms yeah I mean I could just  
say instant I mean it's also like the difference 
about that mini is kind of reviewer and Problem  
Solver in our team hello and it was before like 
that and uh Elma is a allrounder like he can do  
almost everything on a good level and that's what 
we like in him uh just like it's like in like what  
we noticed when he came into the team and also I 
think it's the way how like Elma approaches to the  
coaching it's I I really like it it's I mean 
it's more coachy if I can say like that more  
Sports coaching so it's it's very good I will add 
one last thing so I think obviously uh Minnie had  
a astounding year last year um and for Elma to 
come in and kind of take the Reigns uh one uh  
anything but a loss was going to be obviously if 
people were going to start typing start chatting  
stuff like oh fanatic's not the same now so 
I think Elma coming to join us for this job  
is a lose lose really because if he wins is 
like oh they're fanatic and if he loses he  
like oh it's his fault so I think that was the 
the the biggest hurdle um we had to face this  
year because it actually wasn't even elma's fault 
in my opinion it was actually our fault for our  
performances in the the start of the year and the 
middle of the year and now it's like everything's  
kind of clicking together we've been through kind 
of the dog days and and now like we we we're all  
meshing quite nicely together I think when you 
come in as a coach um and you want to obviously  
have some ideals you want to set it's going to 
take a while for the players to trust you there  
was a lot of back and forth lot of not arguing I'd 
say but a lot of you know like a teenager and a  
dad kind of thing so um yeah so but I think we're 
we're getting there and it's just so happens to  
be for Champs and I'm feeling pretty good about 
everything thank you guys and I'll just add a  
little bit uh little bit this is not giving [ __ ] 
to Elma I just want to understand how the team  
environment is as of right now because a lot of 
time people go on blr threads and redit and they  
think about that someone is putting shade on him 
so I just want to clear it up yes so good BR yeah
thanks you guys are all the best 
thank you I mean you see on the  
screen he's not even the screen now he's 
actually so much chilling that's his own
fault okay uh thank you so much uh uh okay 
thank you fanatic uh for sharing your thoughts  
and experience today congrat congratulations 
once again for your Victory uh for this way we  
conclude this press conference uh so thank you so 
much for joining us thank you thank you thank you
