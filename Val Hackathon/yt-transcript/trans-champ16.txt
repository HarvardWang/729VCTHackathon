welcome back uh well welcome back everyone for 
the next segment we have here lean congratulations  
gu for your Victory and thank you for joining us 
today now we open the floor to question from the  
media please raise your hand and I will call on 
you we will start with Andres uh hi good morning  
congratulation guys for this winning and I have 
two questions that if everyone could answer I  
will be very grateful H there are two types of 
people who watch you the haters who say aspas  
is watch it come is watch it if they have a bad 
start their mental is like a Crystal Palace and  
there are the those who are the complete opposite 
H who supports you even when you're are losing  
they make videos for all of you I always see 
talita Espin making videos and defending all of  
your next do you have any words for both sides 
I mean for the haters they're always going to  
be like doesn't matter if you're winning losing 
performing they don't care about that they just  
care about like trying to like feel better at 
saying bad stuff about other people and I just  
it's impossible to take them seriously because 
they don't know anything like what you you say  
is like the best player literally in the world 
the best dualist and H carving the best flank  
the best clutch player the best liter you now 
he's shooting hard as everyone in in one of the  
hard Shooters in the world so it just doesn't make 
sense like they're the best and I mean obviously  
to the people that support us H I always will 
appreciate it uh I think your support it's always  
is what keeps us going through and yeah I mean 
thank you you're what um what it's like Worth to  
like get into social media and just read all the 
sweet comments so I really appreciate it and we're  
going to keep proving everyone wrong and we're 
just going to keep shooting everyone so hard thank  
you so much and I hope you win your next match 
thank you thank you uh next question is from fundo
as first I would like to ask you uh during 
in the half time in ice box we see you in a  
clip telling uh then there's Al there are still 
things to improve and fix during the competition  
so I will ask is this ice work then it was a 
very close matchup is one of them no I think  
this one was just a hard game J to already 
played us on ice box a few times and they  
are good on the map as well so always when 
we play Ice Box against them is a hard match  
all right thank you thank you so much and 
the last question is well we are in a next  
step for claiming the trophy we have some team 
tics and ftic next matchup so I would like to  
ask you for General in the team where is your 
feelings and Sensations about the next match
is this for everyone yeah for everyone my 
personal preference is to play against fanatic  
and I think it's going to be an opponent 
that suits us better in my opinion cool  
thank you so much uh thank you so much thank 
you fundo uh next question is from Antonio
summer thank you so much uh hi I am 
from narud my question is for King
King for
we die together with hner
yeah much next question is from
and and tex how do you feel this win again 
against G your ex teammates want to go first or me
uh yeah feels amazing to beat them not going 
to lie um we're my old team so of course you  
know there's always like a little rivalry there 
but not only are they my friends but it's also  
just that they're a good team so it's like 
beating my friends and a good team like it  
feels amazing um but it's never easy so well 
Abyss was kind of easy well for them not for  
me but uh yeah feels good thank you so much uh 
next question is for on Sierra yeah Sierra here  
um my question is for EAP um Tex put it great 
in his postmatch interview saying that ice box  
you guys were changing things while making it 
look the same uh which was really different  
from Your vitality match on ice box where it was 
just these consistent a defaults and I wanted to  
know what is it about your matchup against 
G2 that made you have to dive so deep into  
the Playbook and have to consistently kind 
of make these adjustments um since you know  
last time like against Vitality you're like oh 
we can just go away against if we think we're  
a better team no matter how many people are 
there how many times we we hit that site yeah  
well I think ASAS already said it like they 
beat us a couple of times on on ice box and  
we we knew that they have the the key to to beat 
us they they knew how to play against us in order  
to close out ice box so we had to we had to swap 
around uh because obviously the last two times we  
played them even though one was in split one 
uh it whatever we were doing wasn't working  
that well so we had to we had to switch up quite 
a quite a few things even though it was like small  
things we we just had to swap them otherwise it 
would have been uh really hard to to win this one
thank you so much uh next question 
is from and H just a last words H be  
careful ASAS won the game and we'll 
have the big hammer guys I forgot
about H's coming
guys uh well we have some 
question here in the room yeah
go hello guys and congratulations with the 
win I have very like not serious question to  
text following following your like a post match 
interview you said that like with G2 you have  
this mind games and then you said that you're 
like messing in the bathroom and you said it  
sounded weird and refus to elaborate so um I got 
curious about the mental Warfare what's going on  
like behind the stage um if you could just bring 
some you know context I think it would be very  
interesting to hear for the fans thank you yeah 
I think a little context here is important um you  
think it's not what you think um n but we're just 
in the bathroom like you know just trolling each  
other like even outside the bathroom like in the 
lobby like yeah we're going to show you like we  
just talk like we just talk [ __ ] to each other 
Sor we just talk smack to each other like all the  
time uh like on Match day we just tell each other 
yo we're not friends today or like I'm walking  
out the prac room at 3:00 a.m. and I see Trent and 
he just throws a not a nice finger at me you know  
just for fun um so it's just friendly banter 
really that's that's all it is okay thank you  
and one more question uh you said that you think 
that it's going to be close match between fanatic  
and Heretics but in your opinion Heretics will be 
stronger tonight can I ask why um I mean fanatic  
are always playing really structured and I think 
Heretics uh are kind of good against that play  
style I think they just kind of run around and 
abuse their like individual skill so it's going  
to be really important for fanatic to really cover 
all their bases to make sure they win and yeah I  
mean I think Alpha year is going to drop a nuke 
on these guys but uh it's going to be hard still I  
think Heretics will probably come out with the win 
by dropping the new you mean something else apart  
from his hair color yeah yeah his hair color might 
buff him I don't know it might buff him or Nerf  
him I think he's going to be insane okay thank you 
so much and good luck in the next round thank you  
okay guys uh thank you uh for being 
here uh congrat congratulations once  
again your Victory uh thank you 
thank you thank you thank you
