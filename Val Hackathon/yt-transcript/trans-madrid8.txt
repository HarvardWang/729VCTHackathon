questions for the team please use a  
zoom hand raise feature we will start with 
in-person media first and and move to remote
media hi guys I'm from B Gamer agency from  
Peru and after the elimination 
what's the next step for paper
Rex um go home take a short break I think 
sleep yeah then come back CCH up on sleep  
uh we I think we have like a week and a half 
before we have to start split one so there's  
not much time we just have to come back review 
and try BS back thank you thank you thank you  
hi guys um I don't know you're in a pack team 
you are kind of far from home but Madrid crowd  
I don't know feels you I don't know if you 
feel the same way but they were cheering up  
as you were at home team so I don't know it's 
crazy for you how do you feel it I think very  
touching you know yeah that um you can go to 
a different continent alog together and people  
still support you you know to we didn't win but 
uh I'm I'm glad to know that we have like a lot  
of fans and we hope we didn't disappoint them 
too much thank you so much thank you hey guys  
Andre from stream from strafe again first of all 
the floss know it's not easy to come back here  
and talk a little bit about what happened 
but uh top three in visity Masters Madrid  
I feel hope you feel very proud of yourselves 
the second Pacific team in top three JG will  
fight for either second or first place uh what 
are the learnings the early learnings you have  
from the event overall not only from this match 
and how can you take this learning experience  
and sharing a lot of your uh expertise with other 
teams in the server through the rest of the season
I don't want to share learnings with 
other teams no but uh I think um
um oh it's a bit I'm a bit blur right now actually 
anyone want to answer this sorry can you repeat  
the question what are learnings from this event 
I think I'll say never give up I'll say because  
I mean yeah I mean we kep the this even with one 
goal was to work on our mental uh mental strength  
you know I think we came in with a little bit we 
knew it's going to be a difficult tournament for  
us so I think firstly we're proud of ourselves um 
secondly very proud of geni I think more more than  
anything and it's good to know that we've learned 
that our Rivals you know we have new we have new  
challenges in Pacific and we want to we want to 
grow and match the the level right now um I think  
the opportunity to scrim and play against all 
these other International Teams is um is a is a  
good thing for us you know like every time we play 
we learn a little bit more um you could see today  
that centors was super prepared on Sunset you know 
and I think it's good for us to know that people  
can do this these things to us we can't just buo 
our way through a bomb site so we would uh go back  
and it's good for us to refine our game I think 
awesome good luck guys rest of your season thank
you Alex hello so I wanted to ask how has the 
mental of the team been uh since Champions were  
obviously everyone is popping off and this uh 
this onment has been a bit shaky so could you  
shed some light on that um I think losing the 
Grand Final of Pacific you know bothered us  
a little bit you know I mean sometimes your head 
is in the right space I think we you know we told  
ourselves look it doesn't matter with qualifier 
for Madrid but actually realize that you really  
want to win and when you lose these kind of games 
you know it makes it a little bit more you feel  
like okay you know there's something to work for 
um but because of that I think we came into this  
tournament thinking okay we need to play well 
we lose to EDG you know after that we we feel  
like we don't feel very good you know what I mean 
so after that was uphill B on trying to just make  
ourselves feel better try to assure ourselves 
that we are still a top team in the world um  
it's better now you know I think we succeeded 
a little bit there's still a lot of work to do  
but I think that's probably our mean take away 
like We we have work to do thanks Alex thank you
all right we'll now move to remote media questions 
first question from Brandon Esports GG uh thank  
you very much I'll direct this to Alex as well but 
if anybody else wants any input please do uh you  
know we've heard in interviews press conferences 
all throughout the tournament you guys kind  
of aren't 100% with getting you know Monette 
caught up just with the team vibing whatever  
the situation may be uh so I just like kind of 
your opinion if third place is where you guys are  
at you know with these issues what does paperex 
look like going forward once you reach that 100%  
and get those problems smoothed out I honestly 
think like even though we have issue I don't think  
it's Unique to us you know other teams are also 
trying to find out find their way is not as we we  
third place now but once we smooth everything 
out I would like to I would like to see that  
we're better than what we are right now but I also 
believe that everyone else is going to improve as  
well you know so hopefully we challenge for titles 
we call for every event uh that's our our main  
goal our our mindset to these kind of things is 
that when you enter a tournament you know anything  
can happen you get you you some someone someone 
plays a com that you've never seen before we might  
just lose you know someone pops off you might just 
lose so we try to take it very easy but um as you  
it's always you know our goals are just to qualify 
for everything and do our best thank you thank you  
thank you next question from ganes Atri uh hi 
everyone sorry for for the loss uh obviously we  
talked about learnings and stuff like that but 
how was your experience since it was the first  
International Event uh do you have any highlights 
or things you would take from Madrid for for for  
all of you sorry can you repeat question again 
sorry yeah do you have any highlights throughout  
the tournament or movements that you would cherish 
for the rest of the year your experience overall
experience I think for me probably being able 
to come to Europe again I think I think Europe  
Crow is amazing I think they are very supportive 
in term of not just towards their team you know  
yeah so yeah I think that's for me personally 
yeah anyone else um maybe this is my first time  
playing in like in front a lot of crowd I think 
like last two days it's been like amazing crowd  
for me uh it's more like um for my mental I guess 
think my mental really grows on this tournament  
yeah uh can I ask a followup question uh sure uh 
to Monet specifically you had trouble ading to the  
team earlier now you have played a tournament 
where you played you you are right now third  
team amongst all the top top teams in valant 
how would you rate your Synergy with the team  
right now compared to the start of the tournament 
six or seven out of 10 I guess it's not like I'll  
say six or seven because it's not like that good 
you know because there's still a lot of gaps I  
say yep thank you you thank you next is sports 
ke Esports uh yes my question question is for  
Alex Alex you've mentioned in previous interviews 
how your team is looking to sort of remold itself  
and form a new identity would you say You' 
have gotten closer to that despite the loss
today yeah I mean I think we look like a 
very different de tournament um I take a  
while you know we're trying to we're trying 
to undo three years worth of work in in well  
maybe not all three years but we're trying to 
like mesh it together um even B is teaching us  
things from from from his own previous team you 
know so like the ways he the way he likes to do  
things maybe we don't agree with it but then we 
take it into consideration so this takes a this  
process takes a while um I think so far so good 
you know I think it's on the right track and we'll  
see what happens in Sp one thank you so much 
thank you thank you thank you next is will go
gamers
will are you
there all right we'll come back to him uh Razer 
um hi guys sorry for your loss um I've got I'm  
from the valerant competitive community and we've 
got a couple questions for you um from mon um now  
that you have an actual Taste of the international 
stage what knowledge have you gained and how are  
you going to use your experience he heading into 
Pacific stage one H nothing much I will say it's  
just that anything can happen on land you know 
because it's such a different environment that's
it thank you um and then coming to forsaken 
um you noted that this is currently the era  
of Sentinels after the defeat from Sentinels 
do you believe sen can win against genen uh on  
the rematch and ultimately claim the trophy 
um uh I think yeah I'll say that Sentinels  
is really great right now I mean since the 
Pacific uh since the last tourament when I  
fought against them I can felt that they really 
really grow so fast they really improve so fast  
and I can tell that uh in s era but I think 
this time I'm going to support my Pacific  
team you know Genji so I hope they I hope the 
Genji can beat nothing else thank you very
much all right thank you that was 
the final question question thanks
