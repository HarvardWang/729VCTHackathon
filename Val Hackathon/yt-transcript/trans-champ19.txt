hello today we are joined by G2 
who are coming off of their match  
against fanatic we'll begin with 
questions from the remote media  
and then move on to the in-house media 
we'll take the first question from Pedro
Romero hey guys uh first and foremost 
commiserations on the loss and subsequent  
elimination from newent I know it's a very 
tough way to to to handle this but I really  
do appreciate you guys giving us the time got a 
question for valin uh I gotta fast forward over  
to the final round you guys were in a 4v2 
situation with a chance to extend this to  
overtime in the map just want to ask you what 
was going on within the team calwise and what  
you think just led to fanatic just coming out 
on top on that final round uh I think we were  
focusing on trying to like calm down a bit 
because we're up 4v2 so we're all just like  
grouping up together and unfortunately like we 
took the two safe approach and that's on me so  
you know we didn't really have any map control 
we didn't really understand where they were so  
we just thought or I thought we could just went 
off like our post plant util but um yeah honestly  
like it just comes down to us trying to like 
calm each other down regain and then execute  
and we just took the two safe approach and in a 
very high pressure moment like that you're up 4v2  
you just think don't like don't get picked uh 
that's how I was thinking so I just went with  
a safe option but it didn't work so whatever 
thank you we'll take the next question from
snay uh yes thank you my question is for Valen 
first of all commiserations on the loss so this  
was your first appearance in Champions so just 
wanted to know in general what would you say are  
your biggest takeaways from this event and your 
first year in the franchise league as a whole
um I don't know I haven't processed all that yet 
honestly but like first year in franchising was  
definitely a successful one I would say um 
obviously I want the ending to be better I'm  
devastated right now but you know we team from 
Ascension going top three in Shanghai top top  
eight in Champs like we had a good year so I'm 
proud but yeah I mean I guess I haven't learned  
about like the tournament yet I have to watch the 
games back in like just process everything because  
it's all fresh right now so thank you so much 
thank you we'll take the next question from FD
news uh please unmute your
mic uh we'll move to arnob hi guys well uh go 
ahead FD FD news go ahead and uh now can you  
hear me yes well uh it's a tough moment guys but 
well my question is going to be for shos uh since  
the last time we talk uh the team has evoled 
a lot H between the during the regular season  
and nowadays how do you see ER the guys during 
this uh whole time we didn't talk how do I see  
the guys during this whole time the journey yeah 
um I think it's been an incredible journey um the  
guys grew so much over the course of the season I 
was just I was just in a room you know we're just  
being thankful for the year like how everybody 
improved so much um the great qualities that  
each of these players have Jake Jake with 
his great leadership throughout this year  
I've and I've asked a lot from Trent this year to 
step up on his initiator being so proactive with  
his comms and coordinating Jonah as well um like 
siloing himself into a role that like maybe it's a  
little boring but you know I trust him a lot with 
his clutches and just making the right decisions  
and Nate as well um making the Sentinel change 
becoming one of the best Sentinels in the process  
and then Jacob of course stepping in middle of 
the Season saving us really um uh and he stepped  
up massively you know like he was uh now like one 
of the best duelist in the world and um I know we  
don't feel this way like right you know we just 
just came off a loss but uh we'll look back we'll  
look back at this journey and uh we'll be thankful 
yeah thank you we'll take the next question from
arnab he guys likewise communcation on the loss 
uh my question is for Valen uh uh I want to uh  
know uh your experience as an igl uh for this 
season how it has been how you have seen your  
personal growth and I know boster was excited to 
play against you and you were uh excited as well  
how was the experience as an igl in this game uh 
do you think that you did a good job uh throughout  
this season uh and throughout the season uh 
coming from Ascension and taking your teams to the
Champions yeah I think this year I learned a lot 
about just like the game honestly being put in  
tier one I was just used to playing in tier 2 
for a while so playing against the best teams  
around the world even in domestically like 
you just naturally learn a lot uh when you  
win when you lose like you know you're facing 
tougher competition so you got to adapt and  
I thought I was able to adapt really well this 
year to the new metas and just the play styles  
of teams so took time but like credit to my team 
around me and the coaching staff especially like  
helping me on that it's not just me like just 
doing it um yeah I thought I I thought I did a  
pretty good year uh pretty good this year but 
obviously the ending sucks and um I'm just  
happy I got to experience a lot this year because 
there's other teams out there that are good that  
don't get to have the same experience that we got 
so I'm grateful for that uh life experiences just  
traveling the world and also in-game experience 
so I learned a lot this year um and I'm excited  
for the next like I actually right now can't 
wait just to play next year because I feel  
like with all these tough losses like today 
I learned so much about the game I learned so  
much about myself like how I feel in the high 
pressure moments how I feel like going into  
the game so I'm just familiarizing myself with 
the best in the world and eventually I'll be one  
of the best in the world thank you just a quick 
follow up on this uh for the whole team how you  
guys have been uh feeling and uh playing with uh 
wellin as an N I know most of you guys have been  
with him since the start of this game but uh like 
throughout the journey how it has been um I think  
Jake is the best leader I've ever played with 
and FPS I mean I've been Pro since 16 way back  
in CS and I've had a decent amount of igls and 
I've had some success and obviously failure but  
I think he is just a complete allaround leader 
and I feel like we've all grown this year but  
it's one thing to be under the pressure of you 
know igl and being a mental leader and having  
like resilience and I think a lot of that is on 
him um and I think he really strives in doing  
and it's like kind of like a god-given role I 
feel like um like I feel like he was made for
it thank you we have a question in the room I this 
a question for anyone who wants to answer uh so  
coach uh you had a chance to go down the line to 
say you know what's the best contribution from  
each player this year how they have stepped up so 
I just wonder if anyone wants to say you know how  
coach actually has contributed to the success 
of the team to year I want to talk about it  
first because I have a lot of appreciation for 
Josh um you hear like Nate talk about like all  
those things about me but I personally feel like I 
learn a lot from him like not just in game I think  
Josh like this guy reads like 10 books a month 
you know like this guy has so much knowledge in  
his brain and he is the one to like transport it 
to the players and I work with him very closely  
on that so like I literally like my mentality 
my leadership skills like my in-game qualities  
I would say all come from him it's like it just 
makes sense right like I'm young igl I don't have  
much experience like all the way I'm learning is 
from the person above and I'm very grateful for
Josh how' you do this man yeah hear 
it Josh and our assistant coach  
Shaq Peter um they spend countless hours that's 
why we B riew in in server time so much because  
they have just so much prepared for us if any 
of you guys had the opportunity to sit in one  
of our you know sessions with them like you 
would be amazed of how clean and easy they  
make everything for us um we just have to you 
know put it in the server and play it and uh  
it's very impressive and I don't think there's 
another coach out there can do stuff like that
thank you and we'll take the 
final question from Pedro
Romero follow the things that uh or this question 
goes out to anyone if all the things that you  
guys have experienced learn uh taken away from 
today past few days this event Masters V America  
stage one stage two kickoff all of that uh 
what is what do you think is the one thing  
that you feel you will um look at the most as 
you reflect on this year and now you take this  
this this road towards towards next year just 
go that to anyone that like I would like to
answer what was the question again what 
will you take away most from this year  
um I think everyone will just take away 
what we've learned from this year and just  
all the hard work that we put in we've had weeks 
without an off day or just a couple off days in  
a row and we just everyone knows like that 
we're all very important in this run that we  
had this year throughout all the tournaments 
and just each and every one of us know like  
what we brought to the table and what we strive 
in and what to uh look forward to and what we  
need to work on still so I feel like all of 
us are very sad that we lost but we're very  
happy How Far We've Come G2 thank you so much for 
taking the time to speak with us today thank you
