all right here we go we are sitting down with G2 
who who are coming off of a long Victory against  
team Heretics we'll begin with remote questions 
first and then move to any onsite questions uh  
we'll begin with uh strafe Esports uh first of 
all congratulations on the win it was a great  
comeback especially after the two two two 
maps where you were in in a disadvantageous  
position and then just came come came back 
first of all one first question has to be  
about the ice box map pick uh you haven't you 
have been struggling a lot on ice box last few  
times you guys have played have ended up in you 
losing the G losing the map despite it it being  
a stronghold previously for you guys what 
do you think has been going wrong with the
map I think ibox is a tricky map where sometimes 
um it's hard to stop certain tactics regardless of  
the comp that you play so I try to change the 
comp that uh to something that could probably  
stop like what T1 did to us um so that that map 
although it was a loss um it really came down  
to relative inexperience playing the new comp um 
dealing with the pressure that they would apply  
to us uh especially with the Jet and just making 
sure like we make the right decisions um and if  
you watch the tape like there was moments where we 
could have won those rounds but like our spacing  
and trading was bad so like the fundamentals and 
the macro like needs to uh be cleaned up a little  
bit I think but that's uh we have time to fix that 
yeah can I ask a followup question go ahead yeah  
uh as a I mean after the after the ice box loss 
you always obviously it get gets into gets to  
asent and you go down 112 what was the discussion 
like during the half time that you so that you  
guys can come back and force a third not only 
force a third map but when uh loot is convincingly
well we always like believe no matter what like 
despite the score line um like we knew that like  
if we just get this round and the next round 
like one round at a time and just uh really  
get our fundamentals our micro and macr coms um 
like really up to speed just play for each other  
uh good things will happen and so next thing you 
KN like know like we were tied and like we saw  
like um we can just close it out from there yeah 
thank you congratulations once again thank you  
can you guys like walk us through what's going on 
during that comback during that comeback who's on  
the coms kind of holding the mental of the team 
together like what what what's going on well we  
I think uh we started off with saying g210 because 
that's a when we first started this team or like  
joined G2 we had a a 10-2 lead against Sentinels 
and we lost that so then the meme became g210 so  
uh I probably said it I think a couple of us said 
it you know just make us laugh and like Josh said  
it's just one one round at a time and then um 
once it gets to like 116 117 like that's when  
we know we're making this comeback and you 
know we're just going to use that momentum  
into Lotus looking ahead a little bit how do 
you guys feel about playing the Mercedes-Benz
Arena I mean it was definitely my first goal 
coming to Shanghai like my first goal when  
I came here was I want to get into the 
arena and now that we made it I'm just  
eyes focused on winning the whole thing 
so feels I mean I don't know it feels very  
exciting of course but my eyes are just 
locked in on lifting that trophy if you  
guys have to pick anybody to play in the 
finals who would you want 100 thieves 100  
thieves all America's finals yep yep that 
be sick nice we'll go next to nerditude oh
first of all congratulations it was a match that I 
suffer and enjoy it like you won't believe and my  
question is for balling and Josh if he wants to 
add something I I like to know what the mindset  
and the call were during that 112 to make that 
combat happen um I mean personally I feel like  
we all have pretty strong mental and we had a 
comeback in the group stage here versus T1 so  
we know anything is called possible regardless 
of the score on top of that we've always had  
lights out defense on Ascent specifically so 
once we started picking up the comms and you  
know round by round just inch by inch trying 
to get that uh comeback like starting it felt  
pretty easy like we just did our thing we 
didn't have to do too much or do too little  
we just really just did our thing and it was 
working they couldn't stop us we we just had  
great crossmap communication some big sight holds 
from leaf and Trent at B because they're trying  
to just rush B and disrespect B but they held the 
fort down so big shout outs to them also Jonah P  
like ran out heaven and got a 4K that saved 
the game everyone just had huge individual  
moments when we needed it and that's how you 
just completely shut out a team it felt pretty
easy thank you so much um to add to that like 
it's easy in the sense that like once you're  
in your game um in your own Flow State like you 
don't really think too much you just really it's  
literally just round by round I know it's a cliche 
but you just think about like what's our next play  
what are they going to do and just like anticipate 
so um like we got Playmakers on this team no one's  
afraid to do anything so like I I'm just just 
happy to watch that but f is that something that  
you guys train for leading up to these matches 
like mental resilience is yeah I mean it was a  
big it was a big Focus for us um like kickoff told 
us VCT kickoff told us like oh this might be an  
issue for us like we're crumbling Under Pressure 
like we lose leads um and so so like a big Focus  
um including like getting help from a performance 
coach um just having the tools mental tools  
necessary to like to stay in it you know and we're 
we're not like shying away from the bright bright  
lights now um we understand it's just a game and 
it's all within our control and just control what  
we can control and results results speak for 
themselves thank you we'll go next to uh strafe  
Fe Sports uh this is to Jonah and Trent you guys 
have been together for a while starting from the  
guard wining qualifying for First International 
Tournament then running it back through the  
Ascension and now qualifying for Shanghai and 
getting your top best placement yet it is not  
just for all both all three of you but also for 
the rest of the individuals and the team this  
is the best International placement you guys have 
achieved yet I mean obviously you have ways to go  
uh I mean tournament to play but can you still 
reflect on the journey you had which has been  
insane I mean for the core of the team like we 
went through hell and back to get in this position  
in the first place so it's not a shocker to me 
that we're able to do some damage internationally  
um make comebacks happen battle through adversity 
like we really went through a lot in the last two  
like three years that we've been together and um 
you know we never gave up on each other we always  
tried to push through hard times you know have our 
great moments like winning a ension getting here  
and it it was just a matter of time like we knew 
if we just keep sticking to Our Roots keep our  
mental of you know trying to just get better every 
day help each other get better like be critiquing  
on each other and eventually our time would come 
because we're good players and we're a good team  
and I would say just rounding out the roster 
with IC and Nate just felt really good as soon  
as we got those pickups and on top of like our 
coaching staff here you know getting Josh and Shaq  
everything just feels really good here it feels 
like the core is able to each our new players  
how we want to play they take in what we want add 
their own flare you know like this guy's just an  
outlaw abuser like that's insane for us right 
everyone adds their own flare to the team and  
we just kind of brought them um the culture or we 
kept the same culture throughout the years and I I  
just think it's a winning culture so not surprised 
that we're here anything you guys want to add
Jonah um something small like I wouldn't want 
to do this with any other team any other players  
um I'm grateful my like Trent and and 
Valance still trust me all this time  
you know I always trust them and uh it's 
just it just proves like how much like  
team chemistry we have that it just works 
out in the end and just staying together  
and just building a foundation is critical 
for a team and that's what we did y thank
you thank you are there any more questions for G2
G2 congratulations on your 
Victory we'll see you at the arena
