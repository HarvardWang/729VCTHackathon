we'll begin with questions from the remote 
media and then move to the in-person media  
we'll start with sports Kea U hello guys 
commiserations on the loss my question  
is for Coach Alex so on icebox there 
seemed to be a lot of hesitation and  
trouble when it came down to closing 
out advantageous situations were these  
errors forced due to nerves or was hund 
thieves just dealing with the situation
better probably above I think uh I think 
they won a lot of very Cru rounds you know  
and made it very difficult for us so Co us to 
them but yeah bit both thank you you we'll go  
next to jinx TV Rabia hello can you hear 
me yes oh sorry uh my mic was not working  
um uh first of all so sorry for the loss 
today you guys played insane my question is  
about the first round of the ODOT on ice box you 
guys had the man Advantage it was 2V1 against bang  
um but something peaked um came forward to kill 
him and then um bang it was one V one and bang  
won the round do you think that overp kind of 
costed you the and obviously the series there  
I mean he had to check if he got half so it's 
pretty much not we nothing we could do I mean  
we could swing together but he could he was on a 
bomb so he could have gotten both anyway I don't  
think it's his fault you know but maybe I mean we 
could have taken the ropes we could we could have  
done that Peak a lot better but I mean all in all 
I think it was fine I mean he won with Z Point 28  
or something like that so it's just like if we if 
we manage to delay for like half a second more we  
win so yeah definitely I do agree I mean in in 
pressure situations it's it's we have to just  
work on it and see what it happens right yeah 
thank you so much thank you we'll go next to  
strafe hi guys first of all I'd like to say sorry 
for the loss you know it was a very close match  
between the two teams so this question is for the 
players and not for the coach I'm so sorry Alex uh  
so so on the second half of ice box the team was 
left without any timeout so how do you five as  
players like you know how do you communicate 
through through situations like this how do  
you rally yourselves forward to push through and 
eventually you did you were able to push the map  
into overtime so how what is the thought process 
and how does the communication work in such
scenarios wait one
actually not sure can you repeat the question 
sorry second half we difference right basically we  
don't have time out anymore and then like what's 
the thoughts process about it whatsoever because  
like both team use the timeout right he wants you 
guys to answer U no but both team use the timeout  
or you just us uh no uh just us can you repeat the 
question please so basically my question is that  
you know in a situation like in the second half 
of ice box when you have no timeouts left how  
do youu five as players like PR yourselves like 
what is the communication happening what is the  
thought process to be able to go forward from 
that point on even when you're at a deficit I
mean we just got to play it round by round 
I guess cuz the timeout is not the important  
thing in the world so I mean it comes down 
uh to five players to play good or whatever  
stuff right so I mean we just got to play 
around by round and just uh comps as usual  
I guess so it's like nothing special about 
a time out time out is usually about if we  
lost the momentum or like uh we doing something 
wrong but I think on defense on Ice SPO second  
half I think we doing like pretty good job 
at defending b and a so yeah all right thank
you strafe do you have one more question yes thank 
you so it's not really a question but now now that  
you guys are out of the tournament so sorry about 
that what is the plan going forward onto stage  
two and do you have any message for the fans that 
you want to say this is this question is open to
anyone me take a short break I think it's been a 
long season so far strange half the year has gone  
by only and it's really been a long season but 
uh yeah we going take a short break and to the  
fans I mean got to apologize really wanted 
to be in the mes Ben Arena but it is what  
it is I think today better team won on nice 
book we couldn't hold on Earth so hopefully  
we get a rematch hopefully make it the Champs 
hopefully we get a rematch it'll be our home  
ground technically so to speak and uh we really 
want to do well there so we'll try our best all  
right thank you so much and all the best for 
St true you we'll take questions from the room
now um my question can be answered by 
anyone do the performance in Mr shanhai  
meure initial expectation and the second is 
that's there any positive moment in this whole
tournament what question me your 
expectations what me your expectations uh  
probably not because I think we can go 
more far if we actually bring our aame  
but I mean it is what it is and what's 
the positive thing so far is it I guess  
the weather in here the food in here people 
in here that's it the tournament I mean the  
fans are amazing but uh our PR room a bit up a 
little bit like the p is kind of I can I can't  
I can't go into details because I will going 
to be in uh trouble if I see in details so
