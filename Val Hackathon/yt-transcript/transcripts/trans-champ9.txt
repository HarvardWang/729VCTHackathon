okay uh hello everyone thank you for joining 
us today for this press conference we are truly  
to have both teams here to share the talks and 
experience from today match my name is W Moreno  
and I will be guiding us today proceedings 
so we have a packet agenda so let us start  
first I would I would like to introduce ton 
uh sorry for the loss today guys uh we are  
going to open the question uh we are going to 
to open the floor for some questions so from  
the media we are going to start with arnab hey 
guys commination on the loss uh my question is  
open to everyone actually uh but I would like 
to know thoughts from uh coach uh Frost uh it  
uh this season was one of the most uh successful 
season in the past and from Talent uh since you  
have made this L up at the start of the Season 
what were the goals and do you think that was  
achieved today and looking forward uh how you 
guys will reflect on this season and what's just  
your initial thoughts on the boys uh including 
Premier and bringing a governor from na scene as
well okay first things first uh one of the goals 
was for them to make Champs they did that so from  
their perspective this was a successful season 
we had a rotating fifth the whole year most teams  
wouldn't be able to qualify for their um or out 
of their region with a situation like that we did  
that Governor's first year qualifying for Champs 
PES obvious first year qualifying for Champs uh  
um jits second uh oh no no jits first also 
wow so yeah I mean this is a definite growth  
period for them because now they felt what 
it's like to compete at a world championship  
against the best teams in the world uh as for 
Talon obviously congratulations to them happy  
that we could bring them U some success 
this year you asked about what I thought  
personally uh anything other than a win to 
me is a complete waste of my time so on a  
personal level I'm extremely frustrated and 
disappointed um I believe the last thing was  
thoughts on how I felt about the game I mean 
Lotus we had 12 first Bloods and lost the map  
we had three 5 v3s in a row which I have 
never seen in my life uh a team lose like  
that that and uh yeah I mean this is just what 
we are who we are and we got to get better me
included thank you thank you for your 
answer next question goes to uh TI yeah  
hello uh commiserations on the loss and like 
you said didn't saying that you're able to  
make it this far with rookies so kudo's there 
um my question is about them the game today um  
despite like the two loss uh you guys put up 
a great sunset especially after how on Lotus  
uh like you said that map kind of went at 
a left field I just wanted to ask what did  
that conversation look like in between maps 
to bounce back mentally and strategically  
when there were a lot of stressors like 
that 10 to half like those L 35s and also  
elimination from Champs on the line and this 
can go to either Cruise or or Frost either one
[Music] I [Music] mean it's kind of hard to 
say because well actually in the first place  
I think we should have won on both Maps if we 
play like rims but nope um so what happened  
in the mid in between the games was I was we 
were just talking about like if we just play  
normally and we're not playing scared we 
just do the things you were told to do we  
should be able to look completely different 
from the first game that's what that's how we  
headed into the second game but still it wasn't 
enough and um yeah still was a kind of like a
disappointment thank you and can't 
wait to see what you guys do next
year thank you uh next question is from X 
sports k yes uh first of all commiserations  
on the L guys uh my question is for governor 
so now that your season is unfortunately over  
I wanted to know what your biggest takeaways 
are from this event and your first year in
franchise um my biggest takeaways are again 
probably I need to be more consistent um on  
top of that I think I realized pretty quickly 
uh like beginning of this season like how  
much different land is um but like great 
experience I think by now I've definitely  
gotten the feel of it um but just got to do 
better next year I guess I thank you thank
you thank you so much uh we have another 
question from Aram hi again uh this time  
my question is directed towards pry uh prier 
this was your first champ of course your case  
has been one of the exceptional uh in the whole 
VCT uh League how was your experience playing in  
the international stage for the first time 
and did you had pressure uh since a lot of  
people were uh commending your performance 
from the league stage and coming to the  
uh Champions how was uh what do you think uh 
uh sorry uh what were your takeaways from it
uh I feel good that I'm coming to pay
here and I hope next year we do better thank you 
thank you and can't wait you guys to see next
year okay uh we have another 
question from Pedro Romero
guys um likewise commiserations got a question 
for frost uh given what you said about earlier  
on in the press conference about um your thoughts 
on the team and the journey from uh the start of  
the Season up until the very end want to ask you 
about what are your the things that will stand  
out that have that have stood out to you the 
most uh throughout this entire year as a whole  
it good or bad from your point of view and 
the kind of things that also um uh led to  
the team reaching this point despite the 
elimination today um just kind of review  
on that again biggest takeways good or bad 
for you from your point of view for this
year I mean started with some positives we pretty 
much can get a lead anytime we want it against  
anyone in the world we did that consistently all 
year um which is really hard to do in the first  
place especially when you have young players 
um I think from where we started to where we  
are now it's like not even close as to the type 
of team we are today compared to then um I'd say  
that with the addition of primy I think of we had 
him for the whole year we're probably going to be  
one of the best teams in the tournament I mean 
practice you know if scrims results mattered um  
we certainly would have been so I think you know 
giving him more time and more reps and having him  
ingratiate himself with his teammates only going 
to be really good for him in the off season and  
even though we're out of this tournament 
we're going to continue to practice both  
for the teams that are here and obviously 
to get more um Team reps some chemistry um
In fairness yeah there are a lot of negatives 
for sure but I think probably the only one I  
will discuss openly is just our inability to 
close out rounds as a group and our ability  
to scatter like cockroaches when we're 
up numbers shows me that we're just too  
allergic to each other and that probably 
has to be the number one thing that they  
need to change individually about themselves is 
everybody has to be a hero without a capable on  
this team and it actually drives me insane 
so you know they become a little bit more  
disciplined they take their time more 
I think they'll be fun with or without
me thanks so much
uh okay
okay so next question goes to Sierra yeah um 
I just wanted to ask like maybe a little bit  
lighter hearted of a question cuz was a 
little bit thick what was anybody's uh  
favorite memory maybe from competing either 
in Soul and champions or maybe the whole
season you guys have no memories wow that's cool 
like any like any any game like where you popped  
off you know or like playing on stage for the 
first time I know a lot of it was your first year  
n these guys are trash I'll tell you one memory I 
have that is actually like kind of funny not funny  
but like I kicked primy out of Trials because he 
did something I thought was really stupid and then  
jokes on me because then we end up signing him 
later and I'm like damn I wish I had the time with  
them for you know x amount of months what was the 
stupid thing do you remember okay so I don't know  
if I say because I don't want to but he at least 
knows I kicked him out of Trials which ultimately  
obviously was stupid but I felt I had a leg to 
stand on obviously but hindsight being what it is  
was ultimately pretty stupid but um let's just say 
he had did something that is pretty T you'd agree  
with me on this it's pretty taboo would happen 
right you're not supposed to do that fair if for  
okay so if like if you don't have experience doing 
the these kind of things yeah Fair yeah but me  
being ordinary and old I basically was just like 
nah bro so I had to set an example for everyone  
else who was in Trials because we had like man I 
want to say like 12 people or 15 people triing so  
I like used him I set him or sorry I used him as 
an example to set for everyone else but ultimately  
egg is on my face because he ended up finding his 
way back on the team and obviously everybody knows  
now how great he is and or sorry potentially 
how great he can be so yeah I'm a [ __ ] idiot  
for that one actually unlucky so that's a memory 
that I'll hang on to and all their throws which  
are epic actually each individual throw this 
year has will always live with me and INF for  
me at least you'll remember me bro that's not 
how you want to be remembered bro not by me  
but yeah otherwise it was it's been pretty fun 
actually this is this is a good group of guys
so agree thank you uh last question goes to Pedro
Romero I got yeah I got a question for ban 
and jit boy ban for you you returned to the  
international uh scene after one year jit boy 
first deut experience as well haven't had much  
words from you guys so uh um want to ask you guys 
how your experience was um individually for each  
of you guys um in this event and how would 
you guys take this experience moving forward  
into the future um for me I think um definitely 
disappointing I think I ended at the same place  
that I did last year but um at the end of the 
day I think this team can grow like infinitely um  
I've been on different teams like we one where 
last year uh we focus very heavily on scrim  
results and um I mean the team is very older in 
terms of experience so we played exactly how we do  
in scrims um I think that was really the important 
thing when I was with T1 and this year um in fact  
after primy joined I think we won literally 
almost every scrim after since we came here  
and um I'm not disappointed at the fact that the 
results don't translate because I think it takes  
time and and honestly at the end of the day the 
blame is on me and Cruz um the most experienced  
players so I just think that um at the end of day 
if we lose it's not because it's their fault it's  
because we didn't set the right um set the right 
environment for them to be comfortable during this  
stage may take time but at the end of the day 
I think the experienced player should take uh
responsibility okay thank you for your answer uh  
okay thank you talum for being here and being 
part of champion so your determination and  
sportmanship are commendable we look forward to 
your future participation and success thank you
