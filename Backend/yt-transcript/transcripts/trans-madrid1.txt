first question goes to manette from uh Sports K 
Esports in the past you have been a part of teams  
that have had an igl of their own but that's 
not the case for this roster has that been a  
difficult thing to adjust to especially during 
crucial matches like today's um it's been hard  
for sure because like I'm really not used to it 
from having on one igl now we have like five igls  
but the team have been really taking care of 
me so much and I'm happy with I'm happy with  
it great um next question goes to Alex from 
Val to Asia wandi what was discussed in the  
two timeouts on split to get the team back into 
momentum in the first time out I told him what  
to do in the second time out I told them what 
to do again this what I say in the first time  
out because they forgot um we basically told yes 
these guys all laughing now but uh we basic we  
basically uh just tried to identify the play 
Star and then uh come up with some solutions  
for it and um I mean I think uh Jason took over 
after that and he did a really good job telling  
everyone where he wants utility to go and then 
became a lot easier for us after that thank  
you next question goes to manette from Val to 
Asia juandi did the gestures by Heretics light  
a fire inside you and all other PRX members and 
how big of a confidence boost uh does this win  
for you going into the next match up mean when 
we l the second map like they throw like some  
trust talk that I mean it's a tournament game 
you know it's normal to Trash Talk each other  
but outside the game I think we've I think we're 
really fine with it and uh I want to say sorry to  
every fans from Heretics and the overall to to 
the world I will say because I'm professional  
play I cannot do that I cannot put my shinger 
middle to the opponents it's my bad uh yeah
sorry thank you um and Mana the 
second part of the question was  
how big of a confidence boost was 
this going into the next matchup  
uh I think not really because on the 
game I think you just forgot about
it okay um moving to remote media questions 
uh Ganesh St uh this is to Coach Alex Prim but  
everyone uh Heretics are one of the only teams 
that run neon as a primary doist on multiple  
of their Maps especially lus you obviously won 
out Sunset but uh but it was still a difficult  
match it was not very you know very convincing it 
was same on Lotus where it seem do it seemed like  
you guys might win it but then they some rounds 
and they some rounds went their way they won it  
and for a third map you think neon is one of 
the reasons why it's so hard for the teams to  
counter them it's part of the problem but then I 
think the fact is Heretics is a very well drilled  
team you know if you watch them play Sunset and 
you watching play they really know what they're  
doing and um you know when a team is that well 
drilled and they're the only team in the world  
to use neon they really know like they have 
everything figured out you know and we have  
to and we have to adapt to it um sometimes you 
know the game plan goes wrong I I thought that  
in Lotus because we have it should be slightly 
easier for for our Cipher to to pick him off but  
I think they played around the cipher extremely 
well so I think yeah credit to them yeah uh sorry  
as a followup do you think uh a lot of teams uh 
papx is known for the aggression the speed and  
uh this uh and the neon pick really offsets the 
speed it also increases momentum themselves you  
think sometimes that increases the tempo of the 
game overall that the both teams get both teams  
are very fastpaced so team the game gets very 
fastpaced and it just keeps on increasing and  
people might get blindsided do you think that 
happens sometimes yeah of course I would say  
the Heretics is an incredibly fast team I think 
they I think they they have fast strats and they  
use it very very well um you know and we're the 
same I don't think we have been as fast as last  
year to be honest with you yeah so um we you know 
we enjoy this pace you know it's it's good for us  
I think we came out on top in the end and it was 
a really fun game for us yep thank you so much
next question from arnard the spike hi 
uh congratulations guys uh my question is  
actually open for everyone I want to understand 
like uh do you think the uh the momentum which  
you guys uh got on split after winning last 
four rounds on the attacking half leads to the  
continuation in defense and how uh important was 
sky during uh Sky pick uh in your def defensive
round uh okay so the first question is about 
momentum carry on for the rest of the tournament  
yeah uh for the rest of the map in Split after 
winning yeah yeah I mean like uh you know if if  
this game is very short sometimes and sometimes 
you know when it's kind of like a Broly kind of  
game like where teams are just trading rounds 
the momentum is really important I do think  
that like just winning some crucial rounds like 
some really really good reads from uh Forsaken  
and something I think they they they caught the 
right round like two or three times in a row you  
know it gives theam immense confidence and that's 
definitely what helped us close the game off uh  
and the next question is about sky so I mean look 
the triple D thing is is a work in progress so  
the only thing we could do is just go back to Sky 
and hope this hope this is for the best uh we do  
think that I mean our first thought was that sky 
is going to be nerfed to the ground so we didn't  
want to play her anymore but it's looking that 
uh it's a little bit more important you know so  
we we switched Sky back on split and I managed to 
be good for us today um yeah I guess it's not as  
bad as I thought just follow up on that uh like 
you said it's not bad as you thought but do you  
think uh there could have been a better initiator 
or I think casy us fed very very uniquely um on  
split no sky so I mean teams are trying stuff 
out you know like like Heretics is using just  
solo breach um even then the game was close and 
it gave us a lot of trouble in the first half um  
I think it's a wait and see kind of thing you 
know eventually there'll be either a dominant  
initiator or everyone will be trying things out 
for the rest of the year um yeah I have no opinion  
on it we we just have to wait and see thank you 
and best of luck for tomorrow next question from
Pedro hey guys congrats on the win um you sort 
of touched already touched upon you know talking  
about agents uh and this question goes to you 
just more so looking at the decision to go from  
triple dualist to now going to double duelist 
and just switching around the agents for for  
for um certain people in that recent match 
against um um Team Heretics than being you  
know forsaking to raise and then divide Sky 
monia to Omen um what what was the rationale  
in just trying in just making that decision to 
switch to a different um composition for this  
next go around um with Heretics after playing 
that triple duelist with EDG in the previous  
game I mean I wish I could say It's a grand plan 
where we beat people into picking split but um the  
truth is like I think it's Jason touched on it 
um that we just felt it wasn't working you know  
and maybe it's a maybe it's only really really 
good on Pacific uh even then you know like the  
games were close in Pacific when we played it 
um I mean we just looked at the we just looked  
at the SC we just looked at the um game and 
we're like okay look it's absolute disaster  
at the moment like we're not playing to the comp 
strengths even if if there is any you know or or  
at least we weren't following what we believed 
in and you know because of that we like okay  
look if they pick split we're in trouble so 
we might as well just change and just go for
it thank you next question from Esports 
driven thank you uh first of all congrats  
on the win guys um so you will 
be playing against a second EMA  
team tomorrow so what did you learn today 
that will help you tomorrow for the player
spot H I don't know Y is good but to be honest 
I mean I think I think they're a bit different  
um uh I don't know to be honest faster this year 
now I I mean definitely e was faster this year  
than last year I think also I think I me cop 
you know they just as well draw the Heretics  
so a lot of trap I guess yeah guess they're going 
to trap I think when it comes to EU team there's  
a lot of trapping you know like trap here 
trap there trap here trap there though you  
got to figure out like playing like like and 
dog you know you got to figure out where the  
Trap is then yeah maybe go opposite yeah thank 
you thank you next question from Miguel Cordo
Esports hello uh first uh congratul for the wings  
H my question is for what M say did 
the thing on Lotus for defeat um m in
paper sorry can you repeat the question again 
okay what mistake did the thing in Lotus map what  
mistake what mistake what mistake what mistake 
in L I'm the mistake paper sorry the second part
is okay um maybe we just went through 
the mistake uh I would say think we  
didn't double up right no like I think we're 
trying too hard to win the game on the CT we  
should have like put like two guys in SE 
Seaside but it is what it is I would say
we yeah but the bottom line was 
I think we were trying too hard  
to win on the second map rather 
than like staying compos on the
situation
thanks uh
chaku and hello guys uh first of all 
congratulation for the win and my question  
goes to to Alex H we have seen in the Masters 
that you have being a to d your style of play  
both with e and t today do you think it it is 
necessary to change a little that style of of  
play or do you think that keeping this style you 
can a in sever thing thank you yeah I think um  
it's a work in progress you know like this is 
a new roster you know and every every time you  
change a roster you know you have to you have to 
really like figure it out again um the chemistry  
is is not at its best yet and we really working 
very hard to just get to know each other better  
and to be like better teammates to each other and 
better players in the server um unfortunately you  
know like we have to change some comps and that 
usually slows some processes you know like instead  
of being ready to like work on our our mistakes 
we have to like restart from scratch uh but we  
are trying very very hard to make sure it works 
as for the style I mean you will see a difference  
style this year you know like every year it's 
going to grow The Meta changes every year and  
we're going to change as well uh okay uh thank 
you so much and good luck thank you thank you
ichim hi guys uh congratulations my question is 
for forsaken I would like to know what exactly  
did you mean when you said the composition 
of three dialist only works on Pacific and  
therefore what kind of compos compositions are 
the one that actually works here in master Madrid  
I mean calling you man I think the reason the 
reason why I said it because usually in Pacific  
it's like we can just fight with our aims you 
know but in like this tournament it's like very  
hard especially with decom um because we have 
no info no initiator so that's why we decided  
to go back and what's the second question sir 
sorry what was the second question second part  
of the question H just just the what kind 
ofos will be the ones that work here yeah I  
mean like normal normal yeah okay thank you so 
much thank you are there any questions in the
room
in a few words it's possible for everybody um what 
team you don't want to see face to face uh for the  
next matches thank you who we do want to play yeah 
D yeah yeah to be to be fair I think we don't want  
to play people from Pacific you know because we 
practice with them all the time and it's always  
nice to see something new and for everyone 
else you nobody wants to see pacific versus  
Pacific unless unless it's finals they be very 
happy you know what they want to see us versus
DRX no more yeah so not not gen possible 
yeah same thing for me thank you no PR
Pacific hi guys uh here T from Sons of KS from 
na America first of all congratulations on your  
win thank you question is for forsaken on day 
one on the media day you said that you felt  
your team was on a six out of 10 uh compared 
to what you were performing last year do you  
feel that uh on this week you've been working 
here and playing here this level or this Gap  
this six you said could have improved I would 
say so it will improve because the reason why  
I said six out of 10 is because actually we 
have new remember right and then we have to  
like start from zero again and then try to make 
him comfortable with um our team our play style  
everything but definitely for this tournament I 
think we will improve and we just try to like um  
trying to like figure out how to keep up with 
the team here you know so yeah thank you thank
you hello I am from 3 and the question is for 
Alice and for someone of the team who want to  
answer is because in the last map in the deid in 
spirit H the team is starting to play only for a  
in in the of rounds and H problem that benefici 
stronghold sign and was difficult you use a p no  
and the question is what's speaking the PA that 
you can say and for the team is uh what was the  
trigger or the or the call in game to change 
this and come back the the first side so the  
thir question for you and the second about why 
I said in the puse is it so defense when we were  
I didn't pause in attack though more we paing 
in attack yeah yeah you're posing in the round  
four I see yeah I pa early because I forgot to 
tell them like that I forgot to tell you know  
we make game plan and I forgot to tell them the 
game plan so I paused to tell them that we need  
to go Rams on split a lot more and then they 
did something else so after that we I paused  
again to remind them you know and then instead 
I gave them the chance to talk to each other a  
little bit and calm down I think that's what we 
did and yeah they they were a little bit calmer  
after that noly the team contined with playing to 
way in the most round and er in the middle of the  
side you check no and you take me and go to go 
to be and what was the reason or the call for  
make chain I think we just trying our plans and 
since benj always in that position you know never  
changeed so we just try to kill him and don't let 
him get momentum you know so thank you so much and
congratulations hello guys uh nor Fromm 
H my question is for second uh we always  
see you H change the roles and champ if 
you can pick only one champ and only one  
roll what do you pick for the rest 
of your life change roll no if you  
can only pick one if you only pick one 
agent forever which one you choose I'll
say I mean I still love yo you
know I'm having bad flashback flashback from 
champions you can see right I'm seeing those  
at moment you can see distopy okay guys 
sorry don't believe me thank what so
what thank you and final question from Arnold the
spike hi uh my question is actually again 
open for everyone uh I just want wanted to  
know that uh how has been your experience 
playing this F format since this has been  
the first time when you guys have played 
a lot of international tournaments with  
uh the normal uh uh elimination double 
elimination format has been how stressful  
it has been and how uh different it 
has been compared to the previous
format maybe can answer actually it's hard uh 
because because the pressure is if you lose  
and uh you need to play one more and if you 
play one more if and you lose you go to the  
home so you must win every single game uh I 
mean it's good format for for a new players  
I guess because you get a lot of experience 
because you you need to play like two or three  
games you cannot play just one and go and 
go and go some that I guess yeah I think um  
eight teams you know every team is good here 
but if there were more teams where you could  
get really lucky somehow you know and then you 
can and and then maybe people don't like that  
you know or you could have a really hard draw 
you know like you could just play like every  
world champion and then bye-bye you know so 
it's good in bed I guess but I think it's
exciting awesome thank you so much that 
was the final question congratulations  
today and we'll see you tomorrow thank you thank
you
