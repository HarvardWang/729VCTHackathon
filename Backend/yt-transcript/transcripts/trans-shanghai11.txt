congratulations yep congratulations for the 
win guys yeah it does uh go to bang you know  
obviously uh you know pretty important plays 
that you made I'd just like to kind of get  
your thoughts on your mindset when when those 
kind of rounds come down to just you you know  
what what's what's the team doing in terms of 
communication for you when you're all alone  
in those situations and just kind of how does it 
play out in your head uh you know before you make  
those plays I think just the team just tells 
me what I need to know like the information I  
need to know not really uh much though usually 
whenever you're in the One V whenever you're  
alone and The Last One Alive you don't really 
didn't really talk too much but anyway um can  
you can you repeat the second part of your 
question yeah just kind of what your mindset  
is like uh going into those plays you know 
how does it play out in your head before you  
you know make the actions that you make you 
know is it just kind of happen on the fly or  
are you kind of processing things before before 
you take those actions U it depends on how much  
time I have but I think mostly uh a lot of the 
stuff happens on the Fly just kind of like off  
Instinct in those situations uh I personally 
feel less sure whenever on The Last One Alive  
and it's like a they have more numbers than 
I do because I mean I'm not supposed to win  
anyway honestly unless they're on like low HP so 
uh I personally don't feel like uh it's that it's  
too high pressure and also I feel like yeah 
the biggest thing is Instinct nothing else
really thank you we'll go next to sports ke uh 
yes first of all congratulations on the win guys  
my question is for Boost here so so this was 
the third pH off between you and paper x and  
things got a lot closer than expected would 
you say it was easier this time around or  
more difficult to win it out and why I mean I 
think overall as a team 100t we probably match  
up better than EG did um this match was 
like very Scrappy I mean on our Breeze we  
looked very good very dominant on Sunset you 
know we could work on some stuff but when it  
came down to that last ice box match it was 
very Scrappy which that how it gets when you  
verse PRX to be honest it's always some funny 
rounds some crazy [ __ ] happening um but I  
think overall it was probably easier this time 
to be honest I had more confidence going into  
the match this time than I did with my old Team 
EG because my my teammates are just better than  
my old teammates in terms of Aim so and that's 
all you need against PRX to be honest like you  
don't need that much anti strting you know 
what they're going to do it's just you need  
to out aim them and that's what we did today 
thank you and good luck on your next match
thank you we'll go next to Robbie at jx. TV hey 
um congratulations on the win today my question  
is to boost you so next you will be going up 
against the winner of Team Heretics versus  
foot which team do you want to play against and 
why nether of them and we will destroy them for  
sure there's no way we lose either of them I 
I don't care they're both they're both pretty  
weak and we will demolish them for sure it won't 
even be Clos Ah that's confidence good luck for  
that thank you thank you wow oh my God we lose 
guys please don't let me lose we got to stand on  
business now yeah you I just made you guys stand 
on business you made yourself I mean I I mean I  
won't lose you're big bro I'll lose I'll show 
you how to lose trust me you are good at that  
next question yeah all right we'll go next to uh 
strafe hi guys have I'd like to say great job even  
though it went right down to the wire you guys 
managed to close it out at the end this question  
is for buo so uh compared to your match against 
gen the team looked much more convincing today do  
you think this comes down to a stylistic like the 
way how you guys play like do you think it comes  
down to like were you better prepared against 
PRX or do you think you're just a better match  
against this team stylistically I think there 
was a couple things that went into that match  
I think the first thing is uh Genji is harder to 
read for sure they're a little slower of a team  
um but when it came to like our individual team 
play um yesterday was you know fluke we usually  
never play like that today we showed what we're 
actually like and like what we have been like  
the last two months um so I want to play geneng 
again I think we will beat them the next time we  
play them I think they are a very good team but 
we just played terrible or not terrible we just  
didn't play like we normally do against them 
yesterday that's why we look so different I  
guess in between yesterday and today all right 
thank you no problem we'll go next to Brandon  
at exports. awesome thanks again um I'll ask this 
to coach zix um kind of piggybacking off of one of  
the previous um questions regarding having played 
paper wreck so many times in the past um now that  
you have kind of you know that experience with Gen 
as well under your belt we've heard a lot you know  
in the past of kind of regional Styles playing a 
part inv valerant so i' just like to to ask your  
thoughts on that if they're kind of similar and 
if you think uh you know playing Paper Rex again  
today maybe set you up for Success if you do meet 
jengi again later in the tournament yeah I'd say  
that both teams do a lot of unexpected things for 
sure um in terms of like they will you know we'll  
be doing a usual control that we do but we'll find 
out a different way that we could be punished or  
they'll be for stacked and just gambling properly 
um and and that was a lot of the reason why they  
were having success in our match uh previously 
along with paper x today um so I think that's  
one of the aspects that they're on the same 
page about are pretty similar about but I'd  
say overall they're definitely very very different 
teams in terms of like the types of fights they  
take or uh just how they play individually so um 
I would say they're same in some ways different in
others thank you we'll go next to strafe hi this 
question is for the players so when talking to PRX  
they mentioned that that uh timeouts are mostly 
used to break the momentum of the enemy teams  
when and wherever required so in your match in ice 
box PRX forced both the timeouts from your side  
in the second half so do you think that there is 
a strategic aspect to calling timeouts or do you  
think it's just for a mental reset I mean I can I 
can talk about it you want to talk about that yeah  
I mean in terms of our timeouts I mean we saved so 
I wasn't afraid to use one early especially when  
we just needed like uh some time to breathe and 
kind of just get our mind to be a bit more clear  
and set like a overall tone for what we wanted to 
do in the rest of the match um I think momentum  
is like a big factor for sure and because we had 
two I wasn't afraid to take one early um so that's  
that was the approach there uh yeah it was it 
was just mostly momentum and then just reentering  
everybody so they what was happening in the game I 
would like to say that Tony's timeouts are really  
good um like uh for info as well like very smart 
like it is uh very for momentum or whatever but  
I would say like 80% of our timeouts aren't for 
momentum to be honest maybe that one today was  
but like it's usually you know like countering 
something that he's been seeing to be honest the  
last two games that we played against like Genji 
and paperex they're kind of adapting to a lot of  
the defaults that we normally do in the way that 
we play so we can't just call like a pause for  
momentum a lot of the time because we're going to 
have to change things in our default that normally  
work out fine but they found a gap in so sound 
like both yeah so I have a followup question for  
the coach so you mentioned what that you mentioned 
all these different reasons for taking a time out  
uh qu solo from geni has mentioned that whenever 
there in the lead sometimes he'll be hesitant to  
take a timeout not to break the team's momentum 
so do you agree with this sentiment and also do  
you want to add something onto it uh yeah no I I 
agree with the overall thought I mean it's a lot  
harder to take a time out when it's you know when 
you're 60 and you went to 62 than it is if you  
were 64 uh it's just always going to be context 
of how many rounds you lost in a row if you agree  
with the call that your igl made or somebody on 
your team made uh there's a lot of factors into  
it uh but yeah I mean I agree with Solo's take all 
right thank you so much and all the best for your  
upcoming matchup thank you thank you uh are there 
any more questions for 100 thieves in the room  
you guys are kind of taking a peek at this 
match right now between uh Heretics and foot  
um any thoughts on predictions on these two teams 
Heretics comp looks pretty funny where it's uh  
Heretics is using our composition here yeah foot 
changed their comp to gecko yeah yeah I noticed  
that bind I'd love to play bind against these 
teams love uh foot griefed that pistol around  
horrendously and I audibly G lost the 42 right but 
Heretics also was griefing that pistol because buo  
just missed a point blank shorty shot nice I will 
say there's a lot of parallels with our bind with  
EG's fracture last year and it's funny because 
what happened a lot with fracture last year was  
people started trying to copy our comp and when 
we play against teams that try to copy our comp it  
always is just the funniest thing to see our exx 
happening to us but we know all of the counters so  
yeah we will be very confident going into either 
one of these matches our bind is pretty bad people  
don't ban it it's not like eeg's fracture EEG 
fracture was like good I mean we lost to G  
G G2 [ __ ] they should pick it who picked it oh F 
should pick it against no we we picked it against  
them last time but I mean yeah but that's a 
better stylistic MCH okay all right thank you guys
