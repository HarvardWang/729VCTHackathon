uh welcome back everyone uh for the next 
segment we have here tics congratulations  
for your Victory uh thank you for being here 
and sharing uh your experience from today  
match now we open the floor uh to question 
from the media so we will be starting with
hey guys can you hear me on the call yeah okay 
have one question round you have a someone's got  
to go first I will uh congratulations on the 
victory guys um after Lev's win earlier today  
and this can go to anybody uh Tex commented that 
he thought you guys were actually going to win  
the match against fanatic because you're good 
against a structured play style like Fanatics  
as you just kind of run around and abuse your 
individual skill to quote him um what do you  
think of this description of your team and how 
do you think your actual play style Compares or  
contrasts to Les's since that's the team you'll 
be facing off against next they're pointing at  
me so I guess I'll take it um that's a good 
question by the way yeah it's a good question  
very good question I mean appreciate it I think 
like we have a good balance of individual skill  
in macr and for me it's good that he thinks like 
that because then he has no idea how we play so  
yeah he's in for a shock if that's how he thinks 
we play so honestly it's good yeah I couldn't  
think anymore honestly yeah so we'll see um if 
he thinks it's pure individual skill then he's  
going to get individual skill but he's also going 
to get much more in that when we play him thank  
you and I look forward to the match then thank 
you thank you so much next question is from Alan  
uh so this is a question for everyone uh who is 
willing to answer this uh and my question is so  
heroics for now you have been three consecutive 
wins in the Champions and very good status uh but  
uh I want to know from your point of view your 
personal point of view that uh if you have to  
give yourself a grade from like uh out of 10 how 
much how satisfied will you feel right now and  
do how uh how confident are you feeling right 
now about going into the Grand Final and get a
trophy uh yeah I think I mean I think out 10 I 
mean obviously it's satisfying I think we all  
we all knew like if we just played how we 
did in our practice like we' beat them we're  
playing really good at the moment um our form 
is very very good so I for me this it's very  
satisfying probably at least like a like a 
six and a half at least a six and a half uh  
maybe seven maybe maybe eight I don't know um 
but yeah no I think we I don't know I think if  
we keep up this form like there's no way that 
we don't make Grand finals um and yeah I mean  
that's all our goal right is to to go Grand 
finals win let the trophy I don't think any  
of us like right now after how we're playing 
will want anything less so um yeah okay thank  
you and congrats thank you thank you we have uh 
another question from andr uh good afternoon guys  
H congratulations on the win against fanatic 
and reaching the top six in the world H my  
question is for minuano are there a lot of 
people who say that you are the best dualist  
and the best coach in the world H do you have 
a message for the people who say this and and  
the other ways like Lucas Roo who say that you 
never changed rounds and that you were a broken
team my God I can't believe there's some things 
that I just want comment on because it's not worth  
my time and energy and Mr Rojo is one of them 
I've worked with him I know exactly how he works  
um Aman yeah Aman also a big part honestly um like 
I don't really care about what other people say uh  
um I don't really care about what other people 
say about how we change like I think it's very  
very easy if you the reason that look if you 
watch any single any team at Champions not any  
team can change every single round they play every 
second or every game they play like there's so our  
calendar is so rough you don't get time to change 
Maps we change comps a lot compared to other teams  
every single team we've played against not many of 
them change much because they can't so yeah when  
it comes to Mr Lucas I think it's very easy to 
say uh when you're not in our position because you  
just don't have the time to change everything and 
I think we've done a pretty good job of changing  
things up and keeping people on their toes and 
yeah for for Dommy like Tommy has a potential  
to be the best in the world um he showed it 
throughout stage one and I'm confident he can show  
it again throughout Champions so yeah the question 
was for me as well but I couldn't add more it was  
good answer I agree oh Min I have uh one question 
for you how do you feel now I remember you were  
taking arrest from stage two because you were 
so like uh abated from all the the work doing on  
the school and and game and tournaments how do you 
feel now you're better you're doing the you better  
on this how do you feel mentally uh I don't know 
the meaning of the word you just said but I guess  
I'm going to assume it's it means like overhand 
so yeah uh yeah I feel way better now because I  
can focus on weron Purely and and there is not 
a lot of distractions um yeah I'm just like I'm  
happy to be here with the boys like we spent like 
I think eight months together already and uh yeah  
I'm just happy that I am like I can be a part of 
this beautiful journey and beautiful team and of  
course I'm super happy to play in Champions 
like that's every mod player dream you know  
can I say something quickly I think DOI minu is 
the best doist in the world I'm just saying this  
because is not baiting like any other dualist so 
like KD is nothing in this game in my opinion if  
I'm On Top If would on top it's thanks to Dommy 
he's not baiting he's playing the game how he  
should play that's why we are good as a team and 
yeah that's it he's the best thank you thank you  
so much for your answers guys and I hope you get 
more wins on this tournament and win Champions  
you are like a lot of brothers appreciate 
thank you uh we have one question here in the
room hello guys congrats with the win so 
my first question is not very serious but  
like uh benj would uh rean what 
did you eat for breakfast today  
there pistol rounds and hello boys hello boys 
guys is it hello guys yes guys oh hello guys  
we just had some like chicken and rice basically 
what what we going to eat what you going to order  
I don't know I want to order some a lot of meat 
a lot of food a lot of meat protein yeah me too  
uh I have uh two more questions uh first question 
is to Wood uh like playing as fanatic do you feel  
like more confident uh compared to playing to 
with the teams with uh from other regions um  
because like what we've seen today I think it was 
like very confident play or is it just that your  
team evolving and you're just reaching your final 
form uh yeah I think it's like we are evolving as  
a team uh everyone is RIS individual performance 
so uh it's about with my performance like
um actually I'm feeling more confident confidence 
like while playing with other regions other than  
EMA because we are already playing with EMA every 
season every match and I'm always like boring you  
know again m match like it's like not giving 
me confidence but when I play with the other  
regions I'm saying okay it's this going to Banger 
match and I'm feeling more confident so yeah it's  
like not like that it's like cross got it love 
to hear it and my second question is to the coach  
since we heard uh your description from Leeton I 
think it would be only fair if you give like you  
know the description of their team in the same 
manner thank you yeah I mean I think Leviathan  
are a very good team they are very good players 
um yeah I don't know I don't really have anything  
bad to say about any of the teams and champions 
like every single team we're going to come up  
against is strong and they have their own unique 
play Styles and I think Lan are one of them like  
they've got some of the best players in the 
world in their team two world champions I  
think right maybe possibly yeah so they're an 
incredible team like even against ftic today  
even though we won that first map I think it 
was 133 it's not easy like those rounds are not  
easy we W some crazy clutches it's going to be 
the same so yeah they're a good team I respect  
them but if we play a game like Benji said for 
me I just want to focus on every game I don't  
care about winning champions like for me that 
if you ask me that 6 months ago is crazy like  
even the thought of that so I just want to stay 
focused on whoever we play next and not think  
about the oper bracket the final the Grand Final 
like every team is good and L and are one of the  
best teams in the world so yeah I have a lot 
of respect for them thank you so much and we  
have last question from and my last question is 
for Benji fishi yes you are currently top six in  
the world you are getting closer to your goal of 
being the faker of valerant having results like  
second in kof second in shangai second in imia two 
times in a row how do you feel about the team and  
your souls knowing knowing that you are closer to 
this um yeah man it feels really good uh I mean  
looking back on the year um I think like what we 
are now compared to what we were at like kickoff  
Madrid even like Shanghai uh stage two stage one 
like I think right now is by far the best form  
that we've ever been in um like we're getting very 
close to being like unbeatable I think um I think  
we I mean I don't want to jinx it but I think 
we're we're very close to being there I think  
if we you already did bro what you already jinxed 
it oh well too late is what is I mean if we even  
if we get beaten we're still going to go through 
low brackets doesn't matter uh but yeah man like  
I I think as long as we just keep up what we're 
doing now um there's nothing that's going to  
stop us um and in terms of the faker of valerin 
I think I've still got a bit a bit of a way to go  
I think fakers you know a different level but you 
know one one Champs win would start off nicely So
yeah thank you so much I have last 
more uh to be honest guys I see you as  
brothers that your parents are nil s 
on Weber seen you screaming hugging  
and all of that on the stage I I always 
say see that reactions on Twitter from  
tics ER media and it's so cool having 
a team that it's so it's so Brotherhood  
that is so huge ER congratulations on that 
thank you very much team reach that thank
Youk so that was the last question uh thank you  
T for being here uh congratulations once 
again on your Victory thank you thank you
