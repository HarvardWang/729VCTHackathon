good evening we are joined by Heretics 
who are coming off of their match against  
Edward gaming we'll begin with 
questions from the remote media  
and then take some questions inhouse 
we'll take the first question from
Sierra yeah um hello first off commiserations 
on the loss I know there was a lot of a emotion  
on stage and all of you put up a a great fight 
and it was such a fun series to watch and again  
as rookies it's an insane performance for you 
guys to have made it this far and done this well  
so congratulations there um my question goes to 
BU um on a few Maps like Sunset and Abyss both  
timeouts were understandably used very very early 
on what is it like as the igl to have to carry  
the calling for these match the for sorry sorry 
the calling for these much needed gamechanging  
shifts and strategy when you're in the weeds 
of a comeback and unable to consult coaching
staff oh we need a translator oh no go ahead 
go ahead I'm fine um when we use two timeouts  
early I mean they're being used for a reason 
so we usually you know it's a wakeup call and  
they're used to start winning rounds and when 
you start winning rounds and you get three four  
rounds that's an enemy pause so that's when we can 
call sort of talk again so that's kind of the goal  
um but yeah I mean if we're not winning we keep 
losing and there is no more timeouts I know you  
just do what you can like keep doing your maximum 
um keep remembering if they told something in not  
like poses that might still help um and yeah I 
mean just keep doing your best keep trying to  
find a solution or change something do completely 
something completely different just to get that  
one round and maybe swing momentum oh yeah thank 
you thank you we'll take the next question from
arnab like Wi conation on the loss my question is 
for Neil Zeno uh the map Pool uh uh as uh during  
the interview you said the map Pool was favorable 
on for your both the team side but I want to know  
from your perspective uh from the initial analysis 
what do you think went wrong uh in the maps uh  
which uh when you guys were trying to come back 
[Music] again yeah I think the map pill was very  
favorable for both teams right it wasn't uh 
the same situation as Shanghai when the you  
know geni banned like two of our best maps like 
we still got to play our best maps to be honest  
with you so I mean ice box would have been nice 
obviously but that's what happens when you come  
from a bracket you don't get that um you don't 
get that luxury so it is what it is like like  
there's such an up and down series from us um 
on Haven you got to see some of honestly like  
some of the best I've ever heard us play on Haven 
I was extremely proud Weber was you know the same  
it was honestly a joy to listen to and the way 
we played on Haven was incredible moving on to  
Sunset it was literally just a i they also played 
well but we made them look very good you know if  
we lose like that on Sunset there's uh it's not 
all them so that's that's all I'll say it was  
just you know pressure understandably we didn't 
uh play to the level we should have and then the  
other Maps were just wor you know I think on the 
last map especially on Abyss they just played well  
macro wise we lost some really close clutch 
rounds we also won quite a few clutch rounds  
but I keep saying it that valerant comes down 
to consistency and unfortunately for us yet we  
just don't have the level of consistency yet to 
to close it out sometimes and that's completely  
fine you know it's expected for a team this 
young thank you just to Quick add on on it uh  
to everyone in the team uh this is your first 
time playing in VCT so guys please don't be  
sad uh much more come next year so yeah please 
keep smiling and try work hard and all the best  
for next season thank you you thank you we'll take 
the next question from SN from Sports ke uh thank  
you yes uh likewise guys commiserations on the 
loss I I think despite the defeat today I think  
we can all agree that you guys had a phenomenal 
season my question goes to Benji fishy so what  
are some of the things that this event has taught 
you that you'll carry with yourself for future
matches what have I learned I don't know I think 
for me I've improved um playing Under Pressure um  
just how to control my emotions while I'm playing 
obviously not after we've just lost the Grand  
Final but during the game um I think I'm I've 
been pretty good at control my emotions I think  
sometimes I got a bit excited during the game 
um but I think that's pretty natural uh so yeah  
I think I mean I don't know it's always like you 
always learn something uh about when you play when  
you play in front of this many people and maybe I 
haven't realized like to the full extent yet but  
I'm sure later on when I look back and rewatch 
stuff or just think about it then I'll I'll  
take some stuff with me so yeah thank you thank 
you thank you we'll take the next question from
ravish uh Hey guys yeah as everyone said um 
a tough day today naturally extremely so um  
but to to to try to ask on a different 
note uh my question goes over to Mini  
um I was going to ask I believe uh it was 
uh on bind you said something that I found  
was really beautiful I believe you I believe 
you looked at Benji you said I'm so proud to  
play with a player like you uh could you 
speak a bit more to that too considering  
just how the sentiment was wonderful I found 
and just talk to a bit more about how you so  
deeply appreciate just the rest of your 
teammates too cuz I find that PR struck
me I mean May me in like together for eight uh 
months and like uh yeah like everyone showed  
up though PR they never were late and we played 
together like for a long time and uh I know like  
pji fishy is like the guy that is in very tough 
situation and like in the that High T moment when  
you think that it's over but like out like he can 
pull out the things like from out of nowhere that  
like just go out 2 five four deagle shots head 
shots and like boom you win the round and like  
out of nowhere you get just like uh big like 
energy power like you hype up like I don't know  
like I don't remember what was round but I think 
it was like 3K or something I think was on pistol  
yeah and uh yeah like he can just like make plays 
out of nowhere just go on top them and like his  
reactional m is like the best I've ever seen 
in my life thank you thank you we'll take the  
next question from Brandon at exports. thank 
you very much uh just want to say appreciate  
you guys facing the media here you know after the 
loss like that um so I just like to ask honestly  
whoever um would like to answer just in terms of 
the narrative going forward you know the story  
all year has been you know you guys are fresh 
bces you're looking to make a name for yourself  
in a me on the global stage you know safe to say 
you did so um would winning champions have kind  
of been the end to that story or how do you how 
do you view it do you think the story would have  
continued if you won or does it continue here 
after a tough loss just like to kind of see  
what your thoughts are in terms of that narrative 
going forward in the next year whoever like to  
answer I can take that one if you want uh yeah 
for me if we won today trust me there's no way  
we' be slown down it's not going to happen with 
me Weber Nicholas at the helm like there's no way  
I think I said it in one of my previous I've said 
it at some point but my vision for this team was  
to create a team that keeps on winning to create 
a a dynasty in this game I don't want to win just  
one Champions or one event and then never win one 
again I want us to be at a point where when we're  
ready to win we keep winning and we came into 
this year to gain experience and we've done that  
but we've also created a family you know like 
these guys are all Brothers now and as a coach  
like you can't ask for anything better than that 
you know it's a joy to be with them every single  
day and work with them every single day and 
obviously the goal posts have moveed now like  
we're not going to go into next year settling for 
less than what we did this year not saying it's  
going to be easy it's obviously going to be tough 
but yeah like these guys have proven if they can  
do what they've done in less than a year what will 
happen next year and this team is always built for  
the future and it's not lucky that we've reached 
every almost every Grand Final you know and beat  
some pretty incredible teams so for me like yeah 
it sucks to lose right now but this is just the
beginning thank you we'll take 
the next question from Pedro
Romero hey guys uh likewise as everybody else 
has been saying before me and most presumably  
after me um tough luck on on the series I mean 
uh plenty of times you guys have showed the unity  
and the togetherness that Neil kind of alluded 
to in his most recent answer um still I mean  
on one hand I I understand you know coming off 
of a loss like this uh and how you know sad it  
must be but on the other hand I don't understand 
because I'm not in the server I wasn't able to  
actually experience these feelings the point 
that what I'm trying to get it to is this um  
given that you guys have been able to work so 
hard play together for so long had reached to  
this point um PL obviously a lot of things happen 
either good or bad but for each uh of you guys in  
within the team I asked to you this um despite 
losing today despite coming in as the runners up  
in this event I want to ask you what do you 
think is the one the number one memory that  
you'll take uh away from this entire year not just 
focusing on Champions um just in general for you
uh is no one watching I don't know uh I mean 
for me my favorite memory from was it this year  
or this whole event or this this whole year 
this whole year um I for me personally um I  
love Grand Final walkouts I'm not going 
to lie the the individual walkouts I was  
find super cool and champions you had the 
concert uh so yeah I mean it's kind of I  
don't know if it's a bad answer but I don't 
know I I just think the walkout is super cool  
so yeah for me I think it was qualifying to 
Madrid against na on kickoff because that's  
when I saw in everyone's faes that wow we can 
actually do it like we're actually that good  
because everything after that like I think 
everybody knew like from us yeah we can do  
this like we can go to Shanghai then we can go 
to finals same with Champions but I think in  
ding kickoff nobody even us didn't understood 
fully what's the potential we knew that there  
is but we didn't know how big it is and when 
we qualified I think we realized so it was
nice thank you uh we'll take the 
next question from Robia at jx. TV
um hey everyone so sorry for the loss today but 
you guys played amazing my question is kind of for  
everyone you guys are young and reaching the grand 
finals of such a big event is not easy especially  
in the first year would you like to would you guys 
like to share your thoughts about Boo's amazing uh  
amazing Elling this whole season because it's 
a huge responsibility and he took that so well
can I go guys yeah of course I mean I think Bo is 
genius you know I like the way he leads the team  
like I I'm not going to lie Bo is not kind of AEL 
that tells you every single thing that you should  
do he's just telling you to mro which is makes 
sense and he let you do he let you do the micro  
so I like the way how he igl the team and even 
outside of the game like combined in game outside  
of the game he's like a you know big boss with 
the coaches so they're like the higher ups in my  
eyes so we respect them but in game team I respect 
Buu so much you know because I truly believe that  
he's like really clever person even outside of the 
game like yeah that's I want to say that I think  
Bo is reliable person inside and outside the game 
like you can always count on him no matter what  
he will like if you're all panicking Bo will not 
panic uh in real life he always like doesn't panic  
and he keeps control of the things he's doing 
and I know it's just really good especially  
for young people to have a person who's going to 
be there to calm you down or going to Hype you  
y I don't know just one word reliable for me 
I think for me as well it's a coach's dream to  
have someone like buo I mean it's the same with 
every single one of these boys I'm not going to  
lie but for buo to do what he's done this year 
after the [ __ ] that we went through last year  
and also you know just the environment that we 
had and the amount of hate that he was getting  
externally he didn't let it bother him he just 
kept his his head down believed in himself and  
believed in me and Weber even though you know 
we have crazy ideas we we do crazy stuff but he  
never questions it he respects us and he respects 
every single one of the voice and I think that's  
like what in said he calls micro but he also 
trusts everyone so much to do micro plays and I  
think that is the vision that both me and Weber 
had in nigil like we want someone that believes  
in the people around him and people that believe 
in him and know that he's got that this year the  
you know the sky's a limit for the bobber yeah I 
think um just trust is a big thing like he trusts  
all of us um to you know give him ideas when 
he needs it or do certain things for him like  
just micro stuff and he's just like the overall 
big picture um like he like just controls the  
team so without him there would be no team um so 
yeah he's he's like a very important part of our
team thank you um thank you so much and good 
luck for the next season thank you thank you  
we have a question from the room hello I'm viia 
from nerditude my question is for Benji fishi  
first of all I'm sorry for the loss but also 
big congratulations on getting all the way to  
the second place just want to ask for some words 
for your fans all over the world I'm actually  
representing a Latin American Media and you truly 
have fans everywhere who woke up at midnight to  
watch you and support you um yeah I mean obviously 
we lost and it sucks but I hope people um can see  
you know what we've done and what I've been able 
to do from swapping to a different ort um changing  
kind of I mean not career path but um changing to 
a different esport and you know getting this far  
I'm not done yet and I'm not going to be done for 
like a long long time so I hope that by the time  
I'm done then I'll have some sort of Dynasty 
um and hopefully it's for my boys so thank you  
for anyone that's been watching supporting anyone 
send me messages everything so yeah thank you so
much thank you we'll take 
the next question from FD
news there is sorry for the wait just leave me 
a moment and there is thank you so much te re  
is to be here and I know it's hard to be here 
in after the match so I'm so sorry for the loss  
uh I would like to ask to no the coach um taking 
in mind that you your season ends with a top two  
here in in ban Champion SCH and it's the first 
year of a longterm H project that the team are  
qualified for every International Tournament and 
show the world what gave for and I would like to  
ask you your thoughts about it yeah it's been an 
incredible year it's obviously hard to express  
those words right now because it's it's been it 
would have been nice to have the the fairy tale  
in then right that's all it would have been um we 
created a team that everyone believed in and like  
I said earlier like we've created a family which 
to me is the most important thing because that's  
what's going to be the foundations for us moving 
forward to create a dentisty like Benji sin right  
like we want to we want to go on a run we want 
to replicate this form we want to do better every  
single year and every single one of these guys are 
so hard working that it will happen we just need  
time um and for us to get to so many finals this 
year is incredible but also for me like getting to  
see how these guys have developed not only in the 
game but also outside of the game we have a couple  
of boys who have never left their own country 
before you know like they've moved to a different  
city they're away from their families they're 
away from their friends they're so young one of  
them was in in school doing exams halfway through 
the season they've traveled to different countries  
they've experienced different cultures and it was 
all just part of getting an experience so for me  
it's been a pleasure and I know Weber is also 
very very happy with it too and again it's just  
been nice to be able to travel around the world 
with such a good bunch of genuinely nice humans  
you know like every single day is a pleasure so 
for me I'm just excited for the future and that's  
what I want to focus on now you know thank you so 
much and I wish you guys a good 2025 season thanks  
thank you thank you thank you we'll take the next 
question from Fernando from game Marina uh thank  
you hi guys sorry for the loss and congratulations 
on the season my questions was for new uh my guy  
uh in 2022 you joined fbx as an analyst after the 
one Masters uh and atics believed in you to be the  
head coach of the project in franchise of course 
last year wasn't easy but amazing season in 20 24  
uh I want to ask you at the start of the Season 
like before the games before before kickoff did  
you believe this team could achieve everything 
he achieved and what are your expectations for  
this roster for the future maybe dur next what 
two years I know some people are probably be  
like yeah that's [ __ ] but yes I did believe we 
could achieve this because it was like one of the  
first times throughout my entire career that 
um Anor has given me full control Weber full  
control like the staff full control of the roster 
and you know I like to think that we knew what we  
were doing when we were putting the team together 
um so just maybe it's just me being stubborn but  
I knew exactly the vision that I had for the 
team I shared the same vision with Weber with  
bu with Benji that's why they're stuck around 
after what I saw from the first in the first uh  
you know the first iteration of the team so yes I 
did believe it did I believe that we would achieve  
it so consistently with such a young bunch of 
players maybe not but I think like bu said once  
we qualified to Madrid that was just like the 
the spark you know and also didn't expect to  
I I expected it to be a bit rougher you know with 
having um someone uh like you know would not being  
with us because he's obviously so incredibly 
talented we couldn't have him for the first  
portion of our season so I knew that it would 
be difficult but we were so incredibly fortunate  
that someone was jipping enough to kick Mr 
Patty Tech because obviously we got the goat  
so that made our season a lot easier and again 
it's just an extra person that's added to the  
family and having someone like Patty helped us 
an absolute [ __ ] ton so we would never have got  
here without him you know um so yeah I believed 
in it having to get a a standing it's not really  
a standing it's part of the team um would have 
made things more difficult but yeah the T all  
the RS yeah I expected it but like Bo said when 
we qualify to Madrid that was kind of the the eye  
opener that holy [ __ ] you know we can we can 
do something incredible this season and the boys  
all believed in it and pushed in it and never 
stopped working even though there was some very  
very tough moments some very stressful periods 
and you know they push through it thank you very  
much and good luck next season thanks thank you 
we'll take the next question from Pedro [Music]
Romero yes um I got I'd like uh to ask a 
question towards woot um obviously you are  
are not feeling uh the best right now which 
obviously I understand just want to give you  
a simple question I you kind of look back on 
your season overall and your experience here  
in in Soul in Champion being being with this team 
the highs the lows basically anything that comes  
to your mind you know um if you have anything to 
say if you don't then I understand and there's  
the one thing I can say I'm really proud of my 
team see you next year there is nothing I can
say thank you uh we'll take the next question 
from Sierra right thank you thank you um my  
question is kind of jumping off some of the 
team te narrative questions I've already been  
asked and looking forward to next year like 
we mentioned uh Champions 2025 will be in  
Paris this can go to anybody does it add feel 
to the fire or the desire to lift the trophy  
even more considering it will be hosted in your 
region next season or what does that mean to you
guys it doesn't matter yeah for me it 
it doesn't really matter where we play  
honestly like I think we've gain a 
pretty cool Following over in Asia  
so I think it's cooler to travel 
somewhere else outside of Europe
yeah uh thank you we'll take the next question 
from W Esports okay so sorry about lose but  
our Chinese fans still like you very much uh so 
would you come to streaming on bdbd with uh s for
w yeah in off season I will make so 
much stream in I'll probably yeah  
I I will do it I can't say it but yeah I
will thank you and we'll take the last oh we'll 
take the last question from Ashley Kang um hey  
guys this is Ashley Kang of kizon Esports like 
everyone else mentioned I'm really sorry about  
your loss but look for to your future Legacy I 
have a question to Benji um Benji um you just  
mentioned how special this moment is given that 
you've also come from another Esports and today's  
atmosphere was very exciting there were fans from 
Korea China Spain you know um Japan America Europe  
everywhere and you can definitely feel and taste 
that this is a growing scene and this happened in  
Korea which is dominated by existing traditional 
Esports like Starcraft and League of Legend from  
your perspective of a player that has played 
in other Esports people what makes valerant so  
special and why should we be excited for the 
future of valerant and the dynasty you might  
possibly build there that's a very good question 
um I mean I think valerant as an esport in general  
like for me I I love how in depth it can get 
um if I compare it to fortnite like sure it can  
get in depth but when it's like a grand finals at 
Champions um it doesn't really get much more than  
that like for me I haven't experienced anything 
like it like having to think and just like how  
much you have to practice it's way more than what 
I had before um I don't know it's just it's just  
the game that I love and you'll never you're never 
going to be like perfect you know it's impossible  
to be perfect in a game like this um you can't 
always do everything right you're always going  
to learn from mistakes in every single game you 
play and every single day that you practice and I  
didn't really feel that when I was on fortnite 
um I don't know I really like Improvement and  
noticing myself improve and I can feel myself 
improving every day on valerant so that's why  
I love it the most and yeah I think it's just 
the the scene and just valerant in general is  
going to keep growing and I hope to be um 
with all my boys as the best team in the  
world for when that happens thank you so much 
keep seeing you thank you team Heretics thank  
you so much for taking the time to speak 
with us today thank you guys appreciate it
