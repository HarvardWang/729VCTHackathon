hey everyone welcome to the press conference 
um we're going to get started with a presubmit  
question first a question goes to Martin from uh 
sportsq to Esports being the primary Duelist for  
your team how was your experience going up 
against paper Rex who go with an extremely  
aggressive and in-your-face play style 
so I liked it because I got to fight a  
lot it's not like that kind of SL play style 
and uh yeah I just liked it because I fought a
lot thank you we'll now move 
to remote media questions first  
question from Fernando uh hi thank 
you so my question is for Tomas do
Portuguese
for
for got
thank you next question from strafe Esports hi 
so first of all sorry for the loss this question  
is for any of the players and the coach so after 
the first map uh on map two you guys had a really  
nice recovery and asent was also going quite 
good but where do you think the map started to  
slip away from your hands what what do you think 
you could have improved to to close out the map in  
your favor um so I think the first map VI SAR um 
and yeah it's um it's true like when they fly at  
you like it's you need to get kind of used to the 
play style like we knew they going to do this but  
it's B but I think the the game started slipping 
out out of friends um I think it's mainly to me  
uh because I like I remember like I had like 
one catch and since then I just couldn't like  
uh recover my uh myself um cuz I was like uh 
just stressed out and um yeah like U they just  
did a correct decision just stuck on us cuz uh we 
just stucked as a five and uh we kept like we were  
just real well and we didn't do the correct news 
and uh on defense uh the first round in over time  
we just said B comes but otherwise like for us I 
think uh luckily the format is not the best so uh  
we we still have the most points uh for like for 
the season so like we that's kind of win for us  
and we gain a lot of experience because we don't 
lose like to some new thems it's Sentinels and  
paper and both are really different play Styles 
both of the games we could have won and yeah I  
think heading to the split um gives us a lot 
of experience and at least we have more time  
to to [Music] practice okay thank you n thank you 
next question from shaku um hello guys H I'm from  
shiu for fromo my question is for rank H paper 
Rex is a team that change its composition rols  
and match in the middle of the tournament how do 
you how do you approach match preparation before  
such an unpredict Ty team thank you m uh first of 
all there is you know against teams like them you  
should prepare yourself like you know you need 
to prepare your rounds more it's not about them  
but anyway even that I feel like even PX they 
have some really really obvious R to be honest  
uh yeah so it's just I don't know what to say 
to be honest I just watching their was I see  
something I like okay guys if they do this it 
most of the time they like end up here and blah  
blah blah so uh but anyway of course in game as 
Magnum said it's much harder to play uh because  
you cannot like have this experience in you to be 
honest yeah okay thank you and good luck the the
season thank you next question from
Pedro hey guys first off commiserations on 
the series floss I got a question for Magnum  
you mentioned a little bit about um paper Rex 
and playing against them exactly what were the  
things that they did that sort of got you um 
that that sort of um led to those struggles  
that you mentioned um as the iGo and also how it 
affected the rest of the team so for me like uh  
like personal like bind like defense I I literally 
like um I don't know like they they like they I  
would say like the play style is stupid in my 
opinion the way they play and disrespect to  
um but yeah it kind of like first few rounds it 
kind of they took me over their side and I made  
lot of stupid mistakes um but um I I don't 
know like how to answer that question it's  
uh it's not uh like I think the Lotus was like 
uh quite obvious like that it's really easy to  
play against them if you play correctly I think 
by in second half and was like much much easier  
um but on us and yeah um I don't know I just got 
lost I C in terms of macro I think the one of the  
hardest maps and yeah I F there thank you next 
question from arnob the spike he guys conation  
on the my question is open for everyone uh I just 
want to know uh since this was first tournament  
for majority of you guys uh an International 
Tournament what are the takeovers you will be  
uh taking from this tournament and going forward 
for split one and split two and maybe for shangai
Masters should I take it okay so I think the most 
important thing it's to that we take away is to  
trust uh I think for me uh it's like the way 
I prepare for matches um I think that's a big  
experience for me another experience is I think 
this loss on a stand for me as IG it will improve  
me like on because you might lose like scams 
in somea but one official like more and just  
resting process like the way the way we play the 
game trting it more and like as I said like we Lo  
to Cent and paper x and we got to play like uh one 
of the best Pacific teams and uh see one and you  
know so we know like where we are and as I would 
say that Ora is not the best right now like we've  
been struggling the Gams a lot and we still manag 
to bring these teams into into close matchups uh  
so it's U I'm I'm obviously sad because I know we 
could have closed the paper series out but on the  
other hand I'm I'm proud that uh uh we playing 
for a long time without post and uh yeah we had  
some difficulties here with the schedule and he 
still managed to I think put up a good uh good
match thank you next question from strafe eorts 
this question is for the coach so now that your  
Master's run is over sadly what are your plans 
and expectations going into stage one of of  
the regional leagues like what what do you 
plan and how do you plan on improving what  
is already there I should reveal our plans or 
like I need to say it no of course we going to  
make some changes let's say that's it like in 
our game that's it yeah I don't want to reveal  
more am I bench no in game that's yeah I'm in 
yeah that's it thank you next question from
Pedro yeah this question is mostly directed to 
um Nate Martin and given the fact that this is  
your first um go and an international uh event 
you know it's sort of similar to to one of the  
questions I was asked beforehand but more 
so um I I just want to know how have you  
taken in this experience of just playing with 
the rest of the of the world's best um um in  
Carmine core and what what is one thing that you 
remember the most um out of your experience in
Spain you can why me why me bro um to be honest 
it's just like the the most important thing at  
least is that obviously that uh playing an 
international event is very different from  
playing from like where we're we're playing 
from like in Berlin so it's definitely like  
different things not everything can go your way 
you don't have a lot of practice once you get to  
the event just because of scheduling and stuff 
so it's kind of it you just have to like try  
your best to you know be in the best form and I 
feel like yeah that's just different and I think  
uh the biggest experience is if we go to another 
International Event then it'll be very helpful for
us no but I think for me especially I think 
it's really good experience uh because it's  
new role in this type of like stages and things 
but yeah as Marshall said I think comparing  
like to Berlin stage to here is completely 
different uh you can get more used to like  
the Berlin stage much easier and comfortable 
but yeah I think I completely agree when now  
when we qualify for another International 
Event we are we're going to be like more  
ready and yeah I think it was insane experience 
for us thank you are there any questions in the
room so my question is for Ang so you came back 
coaching this season after winning with game it  
in 2021 so and you managed to build a new uh very 
impressive team in kman C so how does it feel to  
be back on an international stage first and then 
what's the secret on building a super team in
varant uh so first of all I never like it's 
not only me who created this team yeah it's  
not on sorry on gam it's also wasn't me 
like uh uh I had let's say I had my War  
who we should pick but it was a team job 
like managers me and blah blah blah here  
at the same it's not only me yeah so um but 
how I'm feeling I'm feeling good of course  
even if we like we lost yes it's kind of I'm 
a bit upset but at the same time I know that  
cyber sport or um like ort ort it's uh it's 
marathon it's not just a Sprint so yeah we  
just need to be better better in the future 
that's it but I know I'm feeling good to be  
honest I didn't expect that we going to play here 
to be honest like one month ago yeah so yeah thank
you hello I'm tell from Sons of KS from Latin 
America um sorry for the loss you made a great  
performance not only today but during the whole 
event and my question is for Ang uh I I just want  
you to tell the world not only me what's next 
for carine Corp and what do you have to say  
to the rest of the emia teams who have to face 
you again uh once the league is started oh um  
you know I feel like we are much better right 
now in terms of experience so guys uh respect  
us more yeah that's what I I think u i yeah I 
would say this yeah I don't know what to say
else any anyone of you guys would like to like 
say anything to the teams are waiting for you  
in the league um I mean me personally I don't 
think there's anything to say I just uh I think  
this tournament just showed us like how how e 
how much easier it's to play in Europe than I  
know what to say don't play list us please yeah 
don't us points guys three points because we had  
some some some situations let's say yeah some 
people thought that we are crazy you know and  
they Blacklist this that we won't play like 
that's why I'm saying yeah kind respect us  
more so the way how we're playing is a Also 
let's a good way thank you good luck and we  
hope to see you in shangai thank you so much 
thank you thank you so much well that was the  
final question thank you Carmine cor and 
see you next time thank you see you next
time
