next segment we have here uh PRX paper Rex  
congratulations guys for your Victory today 
thank you uh we are going to start with one  
question here in the room okay first of all 
congratulations on the way uh I want to ask  
uh for second so you are going to play against 
EDG once again uh you are going to what do you  
think about playing edg4 against guess the six 
time and on your maybe home turf this time and  
what do you think about their new roster with 
Simon thank you yeah I think the neuros is I  
think really great player and and Kang also is 
has been the outside the Star team of the star  
player of the team so we really excited to 
meet Ed G against thank you so much we have  
another question here in the room hi I'm elen 
from W Sports and first of all this isn't a  
question but more so a belated happy birthday 
to you Coach Alex and hope that this win was a  
great birthday gift for you but just in case it 
wasn't enough we would like to open the floor  
to everyone on the team to show appreciation 
to your coach happy birthday happy birthdayy
birthday thank you thank you awesome yeah 
congrats on the win guys thank you thank you  
that was a good question okay uh 
we have next question is from Cara
this question was from Chinese audience and 
was over to forsaken you've changed so many  
times of the comp of buying before this champ 
and choose a normal one for to this's match  
what do you think is the advantage of this 
comp and what's your consideration behind  
that um I think the reason why I think the way 
I see people play bind I think it's just more  
balance with this comp and seems like everyone 
is comfortable with the agent so yeah just more
balance how thank you thank you thank you so 
much uh next question is from SX ESP Sports K  
uh thank you first of all congratulations 
on the win guys my question is for Coach  
Alex so despite the huge lead on bind foot 
was starting to put up rounds in the second  
half which led to a time out at 611 what was the 
discussion done during that to help close out the
series I don't I don't remember to be 
honest with you but I think it was about
uh how they like to play because I forgot 
to tell them certain things so I I I think  
I think it about something to do with 
Luka and what we should do from there  
but yeah I'm not I can't remember very 
clearly actually it had to do with it  
definitely had to do with like where um the 
foot players are playing in hookah and what  
we can do to play around it thank you welcome 
thank you uh next question is from Bishi Hu
hey guys thank you uh first of all congratulations 
on your win today uh and my question is a little  
bit s similar to the first one in this press 
conference but I still want to know um H my  
question is for J uh with this Victory you are 
going to have a rematch playing against ad and  
it's in the lower bracket again a du a die match 
so any words to your Bros EDG and the opponent  
this time as well and how's your confidence this 
time I mean we have played against EDG many times  
and every game is always like a really close 
and fun and exciting game so yeah I'm really  
excited to play against edj again they are really 
good team and now they have like a slight roster  
change so yeah I mean I'm really excited to play 
against this uh new roster awesome thank you and  
the best of luck for the forign mat thank you 
thank you thank you uh we have another question  
for SAR uh hello guys uh congrats on the win 
today I'm sorry I also have a question about  
your upcoming match against gdg um from the roster 
changes that they have made uh this question is  
open to anyone by the way um would you consider 
this EDG roster to have the most potential and do  
you see any changes from the previous roster to 
this one from the matches that you have seen so
far um
to be fair it's been a tough year for us so we 
haven't really focused on anyone else other than  
ourselves but from the it test it seems like 
Simon plays a little bit more confidently and  
I think sometimes you know when they have a roster 
shake up it gives everyone a boost so I feel that  
regardless of whether he's a better player or 
not compared to howong I think um change was  
needed for them and as as everyone can see I 
think it's it's been a really good change for  
them I think he's a good player you know he he 
he I think he put out top scores against uh G  
too so he's confident and I think we would have 
to be on guard against them awesome thank you  
and good luck thank you thank you so much for 
your question I don't know anyone El want to add
something okay cool uh so I think 
that we don't have more questions  
so thank you uh paper for being here for 
say congratulations once again thank you
