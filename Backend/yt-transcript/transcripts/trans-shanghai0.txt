uh we are joined by 100 thieves who are 
coming off of their Victory against foot  
Esports uh please use the zoom hand 
raise function if you'd like to ask  
a question and then we will call 
on you uh would anyone like to go
first uh we'll start with sports K yes thank 
you uh first of all congratulations on the win  
my question is for boio you've shown a desire 
to play against paper XX in the finals who are  
considered as the favorites at this event why 
them specifically and where do you think your  
team Stacks up compared to their um I mean I 
think this team is better than EG last year  
against them specifically right now um we're 
feeling very I mean like my team mechanically  
is just like the best team in the world just 
like paper x are the best team in the world uh  
they're team play or they're like uh yeah not 
team play but they're not the greatest at like  
the game itself just aiming so I think our team 
is really good against them I think we kind of  
counter them and played them in Grand finals so 
beating them on a new roster would also be like  
very good feeling for me thank you and it's a 
pleasure to have you back on the big stage thank  
you thank you uh are there any more questions 
for 100 thieves uh strafe I believe you have  
one yes hi so first of all I'd like to say it 
was a great game guys from you from your side  
my question is from the is is for the coach so 
what was the reasoning behind choosing fut Sports  
like do you think that amongst the crop 
that that made it I'm sorry do you think  
that amongst the teams that that that qualified 
for the playoffs do you think that there were  
any teams that you were not uh comfortable 
facing like what was the thought process
there PA process I'd say that primarily we 
were looking at vetos and vetos just seem  
to be favored against food uh along with when 
we watched their matches we didn't we weren't  
that impressed overall um they just have a lot 
of gaps in the way that they play the game and  
we knew how to punish naturally so we were 
very confident going into the uh draw show  
that we were going to pick food they were our 
number one option if it wasn't food we would  
have picked G2 and had a funny match but um 
yeah fut was always going to be our number one
pick thank you are there any more questions for  
100 thieves from the remote 
media Pedro we'll go to
you patro hey guys uh likewise congrats on 
the w got a question for anyone who would  
like to answer I mean sure it was one thing 
for you guys to do well and beat foot but to  
do so in a pretty dominant fashion I believed 
you guys only made able were able to win total  
of seven uh rounds in the entire series do you 
guys expect for the for the series to go this
fashion who's got it I mean one of 
the quiet guys should answer it you  
three rock paper Dan's got it Dan go 
ahead no right Dan this one you have
one yeah I mean we all thought we'd 132 134 of 
them whatever it was 133 134 yeah we're pretty  
confident going into foot we know the map pole 
was pretty good uh we knew they like buy because  
it was like their second favorite map so we knew 
when it went to bind we'd probably win because  
we're not going to let our foot off the gas like 
we did against G2 last time when we trolled and  
then ice box yeah we just had like pretty good 
game plan you know our coach prepped us really  
well and we followed the game plan on defense and 
it worked out well thank you we'll go to one orts
next hi I'm elain from one Esports and 
congratulations for the Banger performance  
I have a question for cryo you were known to 
play a bit more passive before but today you  
popped off on stage with your incredible ice 
cold aims we'd like to know what changed today  
and where this Beast performance came from um 
I think it came from the food that I ate this  
morning um I love Chinese food boom spoken like 
a true chance wow [ __ ] me do we eat chining
awesome thank you we'll go next to S of KS hello 
everyone uh thank you for the opportunity to ask  
a question and congratulations on the victory 
guys uh were those things that 100 thiefs need  
to keep as a team to keep performing in this 
way uh in order to become Champions at the end  
of tournament I mean I can go did he ask someone 
I didn't hear thought so um I mean the things we  
need to keep is just uh mechanical aim and just 
playing as a team I think right now for the last  
like two months we've been hard peaking as a team 
um we're just playing Super well together um our  
aim is better than every team in the worlds right 
now um and if we keep it up I don't think we will  
lose a series this whole tournament if we played 
like we did today and like how we have been so it  
feels really good to be this confident going into 
Masters perfect thank you uh we'll go to straight  
next hi this question is for bang Asuna and 
cryo so now that the three of you have been  
together in this roster for quite some time what 
do you think is the biggest uh Game Changer that  
bringing in buo and IOU has you know it you know 
given to the team like what do you think has been  
the main change for that and how do you think it 
has affected the entire team you got that Sean  
we're all answering a little bit like right 
like everyone's saying a little bit here  
go ahead honestly it is a big like culture 
change bringing in especially boio and Tony  
and obviously EU he doesn't get enough credit 
but he is the goat I love EU he does a lot for  
our team and he brings a lot of things so I 
mean it definitely I think the biggest thing  
is the culture change honestly yeah what about 
you Pete I think boo is mid he did nothing it's  
all been Tony and EU so yeah all boia does is 
stand up and yell at them and get credit so  
points at the pig all time he made Matt drop 30 so 
I don't understand yeah mat I love the things that
you good all right uh thank you we'll go next to
Pedro um got a question for booo uh put out a 
tweet earlier today saying I playing foot and  
then got a fetish what were you trying to convey 
there um I'm gonna be honest it was just one of my  
uh co-workers that work at 100 te made the tweet 
and I thought it was hilarious um I don't prefer  
feet but um it's still a funny tweet so I just 
posted it because I don't care if someone thinks  
I actually have a fetish or not doesn't matter 
to man it was a funny tweet though that was a
banger he you better just foot 
uh all right we'll go back to
Pedro so question goes to anybody who would 
like to answer uh now that you're in the next  
round of the upper bracket your next opponent 
is going to be either geni fanatic uh which  
of the two teams posst the biggest uh 
threat to you guys um for the next uh
encounter you how me like I'll do it if 
you guys want me to pick a team okay I  
think I'd rather play gen G um I think texture 
is really good I think the other four players  
are whatever right now and I think fanatic's 
really good so but fnatic also looks bad so  
I'm excited to play either team so I don't 
care I see you guys kind of peeking over  
at the I mean I don't know how you like like I 
have to watch the game or any thoughts on this  
matchup uhia looks like he's owning even though 
he's sick is he owning he's like four in one or  
something I see my go I think it's really 5050 
oh my God lock one2 wait let me see everyone  
wait lo2 oh my God he's running at him oh my 
God no look left left you see the trail the
trail sorry looking good I hope ji win I want to 
play jji yeah nice all right um and I think we  
have a question from the room Roxy if you okay 
there this question goes for cryo just on fire  
today 32 in m 2 today and I just want to ask you 
because you just mentioned that uh in such a good  
term in 100 thieves with such good teammates and 
I don't know whether a teamat have heard before  
is your lifelong dream so I just curious about how 
would you like to reach your Synergy right now and  
by the way why you choose to E Trade Sports Bondo 
G Bondo today thank you I miss the first part of  
your question I'm sorry okay I just want to ask 
how would you like to rate your Synergy right now  
oh rate your Synergy oh uh I think a Synergy right 
now is like a 10 I think we're playing really good  
like team playwise um I mean me and Peter we had 
like two or three like two vxs today um but I  
think our Synergy is really good and I was using 
the trace bundle just because I thought it looked  
cool on my on my gun and because they own Us in 
screams pretty good yeah those guys are the future
yeah uh and strafe Fe Sports if you want to take 
us out with the last question go ahead so my final  
question is for cryo so the casters mentioned 
today that you almost touched Tas land record  
of highest ACS I think you were at around 460 462 
something like that so do you think do not do you  
think do you have the confidence to go forward 
in this tournament and to be able to beat that  
record do you think you have it in your and do 
you actually want to um I definitely want to for  
sure um but I mean I'm just I'm just playing the 
game everything happens if it happens it happens  
um I got set up really well by my team today and 
we were kind of owning all right thank you so much  
and all the best for your upcoming matchup thank 
you uh any final kind of comments on the screens  
that you guys are watching I still see paying 
attention what's the score 2 two I believe is  
the score I think I've already seen two rounds 
that look really weird so I think this match  
I don't know they might not be looking we need 
to watch the whole match but they might not be  
looking too good like like I think that was an 
Eco round that they just lost a thrift it was  
a thft I don't see anything yeah so I mean we'll 
see but we're excited to I don't know according to  
booo fanatic looks bad they only won like EMA and 
stuff so they might be they might be losing here  
were they struggling against foot they I think 
they lost the foot in the regular seon didn't  
they like two them like in the regular season they 
lost but they they won in the lower final regular  
season doesn't matter though Internationals 
matter all right next question that was the  
last question guys thank you so much uh and uh 
we'll be back with the next press conference
