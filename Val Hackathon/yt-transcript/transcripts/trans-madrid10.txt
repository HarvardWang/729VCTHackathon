hi guys I'm from biger agency and I have two 
questions uh the first one is for the coach  
and which is the weakness Did You observe in 
geni to get the comeback we wanted it more than
them I don't know I don't know how much they 
wanted it but I refuse to believe anyone wanted  
it more than us uh I think we had incredible 
resolve and it was a really long series with  
really high stakes and I they were an incredibly 
hard team to play and they came very prepared and  
uh just glad we had the resolved to take him down 
um and my second question uh last but not last uh  
where is the party that's a good question yes 
that's a great question the part is going to  
start when we take a shot out of that trophy 
no matter where it is it starts with that oh  
yeah drinking's bad don't do it I'm 26 years 
old I'm old all right drinking's bad I'm sorry  
don't drink till you're 21 thanks guys it's 
everything and congratulations thank you thank  
you hi guys congratulations um TS when you look 
back over the short tenure of this team and and  
then compare it to those that have come before 
um at what point did you realize that this was  
a championship winning team I think when we 
were just playing and everything just felt  
right like you kind of just feel it out in game 
out of game uh just how you're going to play and  
uh when I started playing with the this five it 
just felt amazing and I felt like I had my spot  
on the team like a a place that made me feel 
very myself congratulations again thank you
um hello guys firstly congratulations on the win 
today it was a really great grand final and uh I  
think you made everybody sweat equally uh as much 
if not more than you guys but congratulations on  
the win so my first question would be to Kaplan 
it's been a very very long run for you to get this  
far whether it was through plins in America 
or that lower bracket run here and of course  
when you are going through that lower bracket 
you're not going to have as much time to prep  
um especially since you were coming in from 
that lower final so um how were were you like  
really negatively affected by that map veto the 
double band that jji got today and secondly how  
would you describe your grueling experience so 
far through playin as well as that bracket and  
would you say it's made a significant difference 
in your ability to lift the trophy today I would  
say it is the difference and it is the reason 
we won and lifted the trophy today uh my team  
has incredible hunger and Grit and that's why they 
can get back up and learn from mistakes and apply  
them so quickly and just move on and so much uh 
came from learning from those losses and there's  
just no way we would have won the trophy today if 
it weren't for the losses and the tough road that  
we had okay and my second question would be to 10 
so this is the second Masters that you're lifting  
the first time it was a very different road with 
the you guys not dropping a single map and this  
time it was pretty much the opposite with uh 
you going you having to go through that lower  
bracket that said though you know is there like 
a difference in the feeling that you felt with  
winning with that roster and winning with this 
roster I think this one particularly felt even  
sweeter just because it wasn't an easy Road 
um without dropping the map uh it it was like  
wow um that's it like at the time I think the 
level of competition has improved significantly  
since then and so it feels a lot better to be 
awarded for something you work even harder for  
congratulations again again guys and thank you 
thank you thank you thank you hello I'm elain  
from one Esports and I have a question for Zen so 
as the primary dualist of the team and basically  
the best dualist in the world how do you keep a 
balance between aggressive play and knowing when  
to play more safely to secure rounds um I would 
say for me it's just experience like I've put a  
lot of games into both raay and Jet which are the 
two I play today and um putting in all that time  
I can understand situations a bit better than when 
I first started so it's a it's a difficult balance  
to strike between like being really aggressive 
and trying to go in and make space for your team  
and understanding when you need to live and when 
it's important for you to play your life but um  
the more that I played the better I got at it and 
now I feel like I have a pretty good understanding  
of it thank you and I have one more question for 
zelus hi um hello you're no longer just the vibe  
Merchant anymore but as a but you are a master's 
winner how does it feel especially knowing that  
you guys had the toughest and difficult uh road to 
get to this point we're both by the way I'm both  
I'm still the vi Merchant and a Masters winner um 
I will take that to my grave um no this is a this  
is a dream come true for me I feel like I've been 
chasing this since I've started in orts I've had a  
long a long long career um and I I I told myself 
I would never stop until I got a trophy and now  
that I have one especially with these guys I just 
want to keep tra chasing them and uh you know it  
just it feels really good like we did this as a 
team but for me as an individual it feels really  
good because you know I have a lot of hate around 
my name and like as a player and stuff like that  
and um I'm glad that like I finally got to show 
that you know I do belong on a championship team  
and I I proved my worth for sure awesome thank you 
and congrats dude the way you said that I thought  
you were going to like announc your retirement 
I thought you going to be like you imagine if I  
just said I'm retiring yeah dude you're I didn't 
I wasn't going to stop until I won a trophy but  
then we won a trophy I thought you going be 
like okay that's it for me no no no we need  
continue dude you scared me I will never be done 
no this guy I'll never be done I will never be  
done Champions f is good too yeah let's go one 
Masters two Champions under your belt hope so  
well a few Masters do Master sorry sorry sorry 
I have the original okay o me too wait we have  
the a regional too kick off kickoff is a regional 
I want a trophy right I want a trophy that is a  
regional hey bro we we don't have that much space 
huh we don't have that much space we win a trophy  
every two months I don't care I was MVP of the 
Sentinel Invitational that's all I needed okay  
Simple Man love your 14 tournament hey congrats 
guys I guess s city is back so my question is for  
celis I don't know if you already knew this but 
Leo Faria told us himself that Sentinels is the  
second team that has sell most bundles probably 
because of your marketing strategies so I'm sure  
that's one of many sacrifices that you have 
to done for this team to get here lifting a  
Master's Championship so could you tell me more 
about your Roes with this team until if being  
becoming a champion uh yeah our road is very long 
um honestly coming in like was very ready to just  
be the six-man for these guys like it wasn't like 
I was trying to take a spot or anything like that  
like I was just here for them if they needed 
me um honestly cap was like a big reason why  
I came to Sentinels he's a big reason why I'm here 
today um and like I I it feels really nice to have  
a coach that believes in you so much especially 
when there's you know so much backlash from the  
community there's a there was a lot of pressure 
um coming into the team but our road wasn't easy  
and the fact that like all these guys had the 
resilience to like want to grind especially  
like tens and Saucy like they've already won like 
they've been there so to see them like still have  
that hunger makes I'm sure me and everyone else 
feel really good um and we just had a really long  
offseason like we knew it was never going to be 
easy um the competition um in valerant is just  
getting better and better and harder and harder so 
we know that it's always going to be a grind and  
it's just really nice that we showed resilience 
today in such a disadvantage in the finals thank  
you so much congrats we love you Jordan I love 
you hello guys con congratulations on the win  
here though from Sons of K is from Latin America 
I have a couple of questions the first one is for  
Kaplan right before your game against korp you 
said it could be a diff a difficult game to plan  
on because of the time that you got to play one 
game after one game after another and the time  
that K had to see your play style here you face 
jeni for the second time H without having more  
than 24 hours to prepare the game and having 
played against them once uh once right at the  
beginning of the playoffs how was the process 
of planning this game knowing that they just  
knowing that they had one day for take a break and 
also that they have already played against you it  
was very hard and in a lot of ways impossible 
there's so much we're focusing on being better  
at that's not just strategic and we won for a lot 
of reasons today but the Strategic reasons we won  
today are thanks to John more than anyone uh Drew 
and myself really leaned on him to come up with  
game plans and call on the fly when we needed it 
which was a lot today and he just stepped up in  
an incredible way so thanks to him that we won 
strategically um John based on this and on your  
own declarations about Ramadan may be affecting 
your game play before playoffs and the jet lag  
and a lot of factors how do you consider that 
you may have uh improved in this week and that  
you have may uh make some more sense in your 
team for you to get this trophy uh I mean as I  
said before it's only the start that was going 
to be hard for me uh obviously the first week  
was hard uh I think it was uh my worst game was 
against guess Heretics that's when like my first  
game uh well while I was fasting but then after 
that I was fine uh I think today because of the  
lack of prep and like because of no time I just 
had to like dig deep and uh make stuff on the Fly  
just pull up new plays because we KN knew they 
would be prepared so I just had to like be very  
creative with my calls and like bring new stuff 
and uh shout out to my teammates they make me look  
good uh obviously and uh yeah shout out to cap 
and Drew for trusting me doing uh some some maps  
game plan like from A to Z and uh yeah I think I 
think at the end of the day I think this was still  
like my 70% form I think I'm still I still can 
play way better and like call better so you guys  
will see them shangai celis uh again right after 
playoffs you said that you wanted to play against  
Genji that it was your dream to play against jji 
you played against them twice losing the first  
game send they sent you to the lower bracket and 
now you just came back for an amazing final like  
the best Final in bang history literally how do 
you feel about that uh I feel amazing like it it  
felt really good it it kind of felt good to lose 
them the first series like obviously losing sucks  
it doesn't you know it doesn't like feel good 
but like we kind of needed like a wakeup call  
I think within our team um obviously we're always 
like trying to um learn and trying to improve and  
want to be the best so the only way you can 
do that is by losing and um I mean I I really  
wanted to play them because I thought they were 
the second the other best team here I won't call  
them the second I know we won but I'll give them 
their respect like they pushed us all the way to  
the limits and also took a series off of us um 
so I just thought I really wanted to play them  
because I thought they could have tested us and 
they did um but you know we showed resilience and  
I'm happy about it and my last question is for 
tens uh a couple of years ago in the League of  
Legends world's Championship there was a player 
who was engaged and right after he won the worlds  
it became uh like a trend about the wife buff so 
is the wife buff truth I mean KY attended and we  
won so must be congratulations again and thank you 
from bringing the the tropy home thank you thank  
you okay uh just just one more question this is 
for Copan so of course 2023 was a bit of a rough  
year for Sentinels and you you came in under Fire 
coming in as the new head coach and since then  
you've been like really refining this roster so 
if you could share a little bit about your journey  
from starting as the head coach for send putting 
this roster together and out lifting the trophy  
yeah um sometimes I try not to remember 2023 
that's the best thing I can do um it was really  
hard to come in as a head coach and be put under 
the spotlight and have a shot at franchising and  
be in a really tough situ ation and be put at the 
helm of a ship that I wasn't familiar with that  
you know I didn't pick the whole crew for and 
it took a lot of patience and Stress Management  
to get through it part of being a good coach is 
adapting to your team and that was a really huge  
Challenge on that roster so I do think I learned 
a lot but definitely was relieved coming into this  
year that I could bring in pieces that I felt 
the team as a whole really really needed both  
in terms of in-game stuff as well as intangibles 
and personality fits and I'm incredibly grateful  
that Sentinels and the fans were willing to give 
me a chance to do that and you got the trophy so I  
guess it's a happy ending for now congratulations 
again yeah thank you guys this is Lou for mgg  
my question goes to tens and Z some people were 
doubting of 10's switch of roles when you arrived  
Z but you're now a du of world champion so any 
thoughts on that how was the process for you
both swich smok um yeah it was it was something 
that I had to get used to but um it it is a  
breath of fresh air to switched my role uh I 
feel like I'm able to be more impactful um and  
set up Zach for Success at times uh get some 
cool clutch plays playing on Omen so just it's  
it's pretty cool um switching ENT was kind of 
tough at first it was a big like learning curve  
and a lot of like just getting my getting like 
rocked in a bunch of games over and over trying  
to learn the role but I've got you know insane 
teammates that support me the entire way with  
like the best utility possible and they make 
my life really easy so the transition was hard  
at first but like now it's great wonderful to 
see you all at the top of the world thank you  
guys thank you thank you all right move move 
to remote media questions first question from
Kus hey guys how's it going congratulations big 
dub um I have two questions my first one is for  
you zelus um you joined sen as a sub in the 
preseason and you just raised your first ever  
Master's trophy so I want to ask you like at that 
moment like not when you started playing with the  
team um a couple months ago but at that moment 
when you joined as a sub did you ever Envision  
This Moment Like happening for you especially this 
early on in the year like did you think that you  
would be on the Masters winning team this early 
on uh definitely not I I kind of came to terms  
with I may never play professionally again like 
obviously I didn't like obviously I wasn't like  
oh like I'm so bad I'm taking a sub roll I'm 
going to retire type thing but it was more so  
like if these guys made it work which you know I 
I wanted them to it wasn't like I was coming in  
to try and take anyone spot like I said earlier 
but I I was I came to terms with like Esports  
was in a tough spot and I was okay with um you 
know being a sub making content with Sentinels  
um things like that um and you know honestly 
like I'm blessed to that I was able to like  
come in and like show my worth and you know these 
guys allowed me to play with them and believed in  
me like I'm sure it was not easy me coming in 
being like the vibe Merchant and all the energy  
and yelling at them and everything else so um 
yeah I'm I'm just blessed to be here right now  
awesome and then my second question is for you 
Saucy um you have a really long history in orts  
like the de now you've won CB law before in a 
completely different region um you switched to  
valerant you've won so many events um I've 
asked this a 10 in the past but I want to  
ask you as well how do you maintain success 
for so long across so many titles multiple  
regions speaking multiple languages like what 
contributes to your longevity what are you eating
bro H I don't know like it's funny when people 
say that because they only remember the wins  
right they don't remember how many times I lost 
on these Sports I've been here for like 10 years  
almost I lost more than I won for sure I got 
relegated on on League of Legends you know I  
lost I lost a Grand Final on another Masters 
too on Iceland you know I lost I lost a lot  
but I also won so I don't know every time 
that I lose I learn and then that's how I

season
bre next question from Sports ke Esports yes uh 
first of all congratulations on the win to you  
all my question is for Zen uh last year you were 
revealed as one of the players with the highest  
potentials and you are finally able to tap into 
that during kickoff and now M Madrid what is the  
one learning from this event that you'll remember 
and will continue to implement in your future
matches I would just say like playing more 
um like the consistency that I've kept like  
throughout my entire time competing just 
keep playing keep working keep trying to  
find ways to improve um I've just kind of kept 
it consistent my entire time and uh tried to  
do it in kickoff and I tried to do it here 
and it it worked out so I I would say just  
consistency and trying to play as much as I 
can and trying to improve at the same time  
while I'm playing it's just it worked out thank 
you so much and I'll go put my money in the sun  
bundle now thank you you thank you for buying 
the sun bundle thank you next question from Zen  
strafe Esports hello uh first of all I want 
to extend congratulations to all of you for  
winning this event uh this question is for all 
of you guys essentially whoever wants to pick  
it up but um I wanted to ask was there a 
specific moment within the series where  
you felt you had won it like you had won the 
Master title you had won the series you had Pon
sheni can I answer are you want oh you yeah 
yeah yeah honestly I thought we were winning  
it on split um we there was a lot of rounds 
going back and forth and uh we were just I  
I don't know what like changed within us but 
like I don't know if it was a timeout we took  
or like is something clicked within people's 
heads or not but on split we were so like no  
matter the round we lost or won it was like I 
mean the energy was just so high every round  
like everything was super close but like we 
were coming out on top and then you know we  
we come back after that map and caps you know 
telling yelling at us telling not yelling at  
us out of Rage but you know yelling at us like 
keeping us up making sure like you know um even  
though our energy was high which is what we 
needed we needed to show we wanted it more um  
we were still like cing very well together 
in those situations and I think on split  
like that really clicked for us as a team and I 
think we just brought that back into or brought  
that into Fifth map and I figured I knew we were 
winning when we when we kept up the kept up the
pace thank you very much thank you thank you 
perista gamer thank you um congratulations for  
this master guys my question is for Tyson um you 
were the first player that I saw when I started  
playing bant and I always hoped I could ask you 
a question when you won another big tournament  
the day has come and I just want to know what 
was the most exciting and the most difficult  
moment for you today and why I think uh the most 
difficult thing for us today or just me um it was  
definitely keeping our energy High throughout 
the series uh sometimes it was a little bit  
volatile cuz we would be like really high energy 
some maps and then sometimes like I might drop  
the ball on my energy but I thought that I did 
a really good job bringing it back on map five I  
was getting pretty loud and yelling a bit which 
is quite uncharacteristic of me and I guess the  
best moment is just lifting the trophy seeing the 
fans around us and yeah taking all in thank you so
much are we having a pillow fight on stage sorry  
sorry no worries okay we're gonna 
end with one final question from
Razer oh thank you so much um uh this goes 
to uh Kaplan um in response to a question  
about the strengths of other regions Alex 
over on paper x had said that America's had  
the best mid-ring em had the best trap plays 
and China had the best aimers but uh that they  
were just spread off across different teams 
would you agree with that what what's your
thoughts um I don't know which region has 
the best aimers but I do think Americas has  
the best mid-ring I think Americas is the 
best region it's an incredibly competitive  
region the scrims are really good tier two 
in americaas is no joke and the best way  
to learn things like mid-ring are just playing 
against really good opponents and yeah I agree  
that EMA probably has the best trap plays I 
think EMA is probably the most like pre-plan  
strategy and anti- strap Focus region they 
really emphasize all that and it shows up  
in the server thank you all right thank 
you very much that was the final question  
congratulations again and we'll catch you 
next time thank you thank you thank you
guys
