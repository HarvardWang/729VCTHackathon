all right hello everyone welcome to the press
conference we are joined by Sentinels who
have just claimed another Victory against
Carmine Corp if you have any questions for
the team please use resum hand ra feature
we'll start with a pres submitted question
first for John cutie from Sports Esports there
was a point in the first map where you had
a 5-1 lead that ended into a 66 half despite
the score line your team did not opt for a
timeout I wanted to know from the igl perspective
the discussion that was done within the team
in that second half that led to the dominant
win on split uh the first half we were up
5-1 uh and we think we finished a half 66
but I think we just we still had the right
ideas and we had the right game plan and I'm
sure that's why that's why K didn't want to
didn't want to timeout we were just like losing
on the small stuff in the end phase that's
why he costed us I think it would have been
pretty much a n tree should have been a n
tree or like a 10 to half for us h a second
half I mean it's split we've always had a
good defense half we understood how they want
to approach it and how they want to like count
counter our setups so we just made sure to
stay strong in our setups trust our eics and
that's how we usually approach split thank
you next question also goes to John cue from
Mimi um she's asking what is it like playing
such a tournament during Ramadan it's not
easy I'll tell you that uh it's hard it's
it's not only Ramadan it's also like a mixture
of stuff I'm very away from home I'm jetlagged
uh food sometimes is hard to get uh we're
we have to come here early we have to wake
up at certain times so I think that's a very
hard part that goes hand in hand with Ramadan
uh I'm also the igl and uh I mean my performance
will be affected no matter what in one way
or the other but I think I just need to get
used to it more and as you saw I played kind
of bad and today I picked it up so as I'm
sure next next week when we're going to beat
playoffs I'll be I'll be back to my usual
form and you'll see it thank you next question
goes to tens and Zen from Mimi uh your teammates
call you the kids of the team and it's clear
that you have a good relationship how does
that translate into your play in the server
together I would say it mainly comes from
the fact that Zach and I have a lot of trust
in each other and we're both pretty aggressive
so for the most part we can stay on the same
page with certain plays so I think it's really
good to have like an aggressive du like uh
Zach and I I feel really confident like going
into areas with Zach and I feel like he feels
confident too and I think the trust that we
have to work together is really good as well
man just said everything uh I can't really
add much to that I just think um we think
about the game the same way and we play a
lot together and we have really good Synergy
and it just kind of translates into the matches
thank you next question goes to Kaplan from
Mimi Sentinels has played more matches than
most what does it mean to finally have a significant
amount of time to prep for playoffs I cannot
wait to sleep uh it it it means a lot uh it's
been really hard to have such a quick turnaround
uh we showed everything we had pretty much
and kickoff and it's uh we didn't have a lot
of turnaround time to deal with that strategically
right especially even with scrims your jet
lag there's just so many challenges so having
some time to breathe and be better equipped
to handle opponents studying us is a huge
relief and a confidence boost for the games
ahead thank you next question will go to Brandon
Esports
GG thank you very much congratulations on
the win guys I'll ask is to coach you kind
of mentioned it you know taking the Hard Road
uh we heard you at the beginning of the broadcast
as well as your you know postmatch tweet without
that much time to prepare i' just like to
ask you kind of what that means to be able
to persevere and Prevail about the character
of your team and yourself uh and kind of what
you think that also means for the future with
having that time to prepare how how does that
set you up for Success yeah um we really have
had a lot of you know adversity and hard roads
and I'm incredibly proud of the team it's
just thanks to them and everything they do
and how hard they work and their own perseverance
in matches and just being an incredible team
um we had to kind of think of a way to deal
with today it was tough conditions having
such little time away from the arena before
coming back and I think we all did a really
good job framing that let's uh you know use
that let's we have something to prove and
we want to it just made us want to more and
I'm really glad that we used it as fuel and
we sh we're capable of that I'm excited to
maybe have a little bit of an easier Road
and we haven't had those yet so hopefully
we're equipped to deal with those but yeah
feels great smooth sea smooth Seas don't make
a skillful sailor John cutie 2024 thank you
we ring through tsunamis out here yeah yeah
it was a tsunami today we so thank you next
question are we so next question question
goes to
Pedro hey guys uh first off also congrats
on the win uh I got a question for John cuy
of course you know looking at the second map
specifically at the very end of there there
was a time in which Casey was on the verge
of extending that map to overtime with um
that Nate 1v3 clutch but then you guys turn
it around with that 3 win with everybody on
C and just um taking everybody down and winning
the series as a result I want to know from
your perspective what was the comps like in
in just trying to make that play together
you did you kind of anticipate that KC was
going to to to go hard see and also um everyone
else within the team can chime in if they
want I mean we we lost a tough round we just
made sure Theresa uh we were on eco and we
just started a and uh we just gamble C to
go see uh we know that KC plays very packed
and the doing a whole half they don't really
have many lurkers they like to stay as four
and they show a lot of presence uh we just
made the call uh shout out to Zach he made
the call to Rocket I think Jordan made the
call for sassy to ey from waterfall so it
was more of a team uh team effort on the call
everyone did their part and uh I really can't
uh give the credit for me on that one everyone
did their part and that's how it goes on this
team you know what credit we can give it to
you though the Sentinels classic by The Sentinel
please how is that credit to me though huh
what do you mean I said you know what we can
give the credit to though I'm joking oh screw
you dude I'm just joking John I think you're
great I'm
not thank you next question goes to strafe
Esports thank you uh I'd like to direct this
question to Sashi and zelus uh you guys have
probably had one of the hardest sort of road
to Madrid and even at Madrid you've just beaten
both EMA Representatives back to back uh across
two days what does this win um against a team
that took down fanatic what does this win
mean for you
guys I mean em is a no team region now so
you know we can go back and go home to America's
happy but um now all seriousness I mean we
knew we knew NBA was going to be really tough
like they're really good region um and like
yeah like you said we didn't have the easiest
Road and I mean it honestly at this point
it doesn't matter now if we get the easy Road
or not I think we've put so much time in in
the off season and like even now playing through
plays and kickoff and everything like I feel
like our team is really prepared for like
anything that's thrown at us um so I mean
yeah for me is like no it doesn't matter if
it's ma or Pacific we're not we're not here
to win against Ma we're here to win master
so whatever oh yeah W that's my vet wow that's
the Vets that's the world champion one guy
[ __ ] talking the other's that actually
showed you guys personality like right there
I know thank you so much guys next question
from wandy hi guys um so first of all conratulations
on the win um I have a question for whoever
want to answer so would you guys say that
the match up with Casey in this s format was
sucessful given that you guys have less than
a day to K yeah it was really stressful uh
you can't avoid some imbalance in tournaments
right some teams have to play one day and
some teams have to play another day and that's
the way it goes but we were the earlier game
today after being the later game yesterday
and that put a lot of time pressure on us
and made the disparity between us and casc
having more time to clean up their own play
and rest and even watch our game live it made
that disparity a lot larger so um especially
speaking for myself and Drew who did an incredible
job it it just meant the turnaround time where
we had to study and prepare for this game
was was short and doing our ideal level of
work for it was impossible um but I think
that speaks even more to how well all the
players adapted and how well we just played
our own game and ever just did an incredible
job with their creativity like we were definitely
playing with less preparation than we're used
to and you know I'm glad that you can watch
our game and that's not obvious
next question from Fernando uh thank you uh
first of all congratulations on the win my
question is 
for
Portugues
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
for see got next question from
Pedro 
we can't hear you no you can um I got a question
for T um your mother was interviewed during
the broadcast about by Golden Bo and he mentioned
about how it's the first time she's seen you
play in an international setting in a competition
such as this you know given the fact that
back in 2021 um because of Co you know no
fans were there but what's the feeling like
for you just to play with your mother watching
by the sides and and the rest of your
family I would just say it's a it's a really
nice feeling having my family there in person
to support me and I mean I don't know what
else to say other than like it feels great
um and this is like the first time ever that
I've actually had any family come out to support
me in any event I went to whether it's from
from uh CS or this game so it's pretty
cool uh hello guys first of all congratulations
on your win uh this question is for celis
this is tell from Sons of KS and celis I want
to ask you uh now being you the first team
to qualify on to playoffs who would you like
to face in the next stage of this Masters
Madrid uh uh I think I'd like to face genen
just because um I don't know I think like
they play really well they have like a really
set like game plans and they just look really
really well coordinated right now I'm also
kind of a big fan of texture I think he's
been like performing really well he has like
really good Aim so I think for me I mean the
trophy is obviously just like what I'm focused
on but if I had to pick one team it'd be ji
and my last question is for Kaplan uh we were
talking to loud a couple of days ago and I
want to to ask you the same thing about well
being being Americas uh the the last two world
champions do you feel like as a team or as
a region is there any pressure in you to go
back with the trophy I I think we put an enormous
amount of pressure on ourselves because uh
we firmly believe we can be the best team
and we can win the trophy and that's what
we want I don't think anything like that really
changes anything for us we put a lot of pressure
on ourselves and that's enough and nothing
else really moves the needle thank you congratulations
again and thanks we hope to see more of this
on playoffs thank you thank
you 
uh hello I'm Zach from blr uh congratulations
on your win today this question is for t or
Z or both of you if you choose to answer I
know that you said like you're kind of the
dynamic Duo equally aggressive who loves playing
together and uh I was wondering about how
you guys really set each other up on split
because there were like a lot of really good
trap plays and stuff that constantly kept
the pressure up for KC and uh just how do
you two set each other up consistently so
much I think it's just the fact that we're
always paired up and so it opens up a lot
of opportunity for us to be able to make uh
a lot of like plays together um sorry I answered
kind of short uh pretty much what he said
but also there there's a lot of there's also
some rounds that we're not really together
but because of our aggressive play Styles
there's kind of like a push pull aspect to
it where I can be taking space on one side
and he can be taking space on another side
but it all just kind of comes together to
like go with the full game plan so it works
really well thank you guys the kids the kids
the kids and the elders bling the leaf yipp
uh any other on-site media questions
hello I'm LMO of and the question is for anyone
who want someone ask for what team do you
want to face and my question is what team
do you seem that we qualify to to the semi-finals
with you with the level that the different
have game in the tournament you guys want
me to answer uh me I think uh I definitely
think KC will make it through um who else
is one1 loud and then no PL with though okay
uh I mean I I have KC going through for sure
I have gen going through um and then yeah
I'll have to go with like the other American
representative like loud for sure just like
you know home represent like when you go International
it's just it's not it's not any whatever anymore
it's just Americas Americas the question is
for Kaplan this question is about pick and
band no because car cor and you have a similar
good maps no for example Lotus or Vine and
finally car cor picked Lotus and let Vine
to theer no ER is the Big B in your plans
or some surprise you because for me this is
important for the match no if you if you win
the pigy bank your opinion or not uh I was
I think we were all really happy with how
the veto went I was very surprised they banned
Sunset and let split through uh just we have
a great split I think that uh their compound
spit has some problems and we had a really
rough Sunset game yesterday so I expected
something a little different there but other
than that really happy with how it went and
we were all smiling walking out of there after
the video okay the last one is for T is because
you are playing in Spain no in Mia and you
play against the two immedia teams and now
carine cor and both team have a lot of fun
in the stadium but despite the fact rally
you have a big support Sentinel no and in
the final for example alter stadium was cheating
for for Sentinel win no do you think that
you have fans in all the Ws and it feel like
that you can be local in anywhere or what
do you think about the supports well I know
there's a lot of fanss globally present throughout
the world that's cheering for me and the rest
of my team um even here locally in Madrid
I'm sure there's a few people that were cheering
for Sentinels and I mean each each person
can cheer for whatever team they want to and
like at the end of the day everyone has their
own preferences their own favorites so it's
cool thank you you're so cool D all right
thank you U that's all the time we have for
this press conference congratulations again
and we'll see you next time thank you thank
you bye thank you for the
questions
