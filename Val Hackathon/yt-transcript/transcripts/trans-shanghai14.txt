hello we are joined by team Heretics who are 
coming off of their match against G2 I don't  
see oh you guys got us yeah yeah awesome uh we'll 
begin with the remote media first uh strafe would  
you like to start us off yep uh congratulations 
on the win this is the third time you faed G2  
and you were finally able to close it out and 
not just close it out but when dominantly what  
changed after the last two losses what 
was the deciding factor in today's game  
that me ensure that you guys close out the maps 
pretty convincingly me um I think we just played  
how we know we can play today like fundamentally 
everyone was on point um and it's not taking away  
anything from G2 and I say this or don't want 
to come across as etico but I feel like we were  
better than them definitely the second time we 
played um and we just kind of let it slip with  
our fundamentals being a bit poor um and I think 
we learned a lot from the two times we played them  
the first time they definitely outplayed us 
um second time not so much I think they would  
probably look back at it and think the same so 
when it came to today we just drilled that the  
fundamentals are going to win this game we didn't 
have crazy amounts of time to prep but the prep  
that we did was good and we had kind of like anti 
strats for their anti strats again so I felt like  
we were one step ahead um and yeah we just played 
fundamentally well and obviously some huge moments  
from everyone in the team individually helped 
us across the line oh thank you for the answer
congratulations thank you we'll go to nerditude
next thank you so much my question is for Neil 
what what mistakes do you notize from G2 in the  
match where they made a comeback and defeated 
you which you were able to exploit in this  
match to win um so when we played them I don't 
think they necessarily made that many mistakes  
that we exploited it was just we knew how they 
were going to play um I feel like we made a lot  
of mistakes when we played them the last time 
and they're an incredibly good team very very  
good team so if you give teams at this level any 
kind of chance to win the runs they're going to  
win them and I think that's just what happened 
like valer or almost any sport when you get to  
the highest level it's literally whatever team 
makes the least mistakes in the day is going to  
win and that's what happened today I think 
for us we just made uh a lot less mistakes  
than we did the last time and we didn't let 
them capitalize on them because if we didn't  
play to our best level they would have beaten 
us again like they're a good team a really good  
team so I'm just happy that yeah we didn't make 
any mistakes and when we did we had some big  
big rounds like I said from some individuals to 
clawback thank you we'll go next to Pedro Romero
guys uh likewise congrats on the victory 
progressing to the Grand finals uh with  
this result we're going to have a new uh uh a 
master SL International Champion that's what  
I'm trying to say International Champion uh 
and that said looking at this team's run as  
as we've been saying so many times so far at this 
point going through many obstacles either before  
during and even right now um at this point 
getting ready for the grand finals and yeah  
just want to ask for anyone that like 
to answer just um if you could pinpoint  
one thing that just sparked this team's 
run and just making this all happen and  
just be on the precipice of gting that 
title what would that one thing be and
why I mean I guess answer yeah yeah I think it's 
just the bond that we all have as a team and a  
group like that's what pushes us through at the 
end of the day it doesn't SM who we have in the  
team if it's Patty if it's mini Boo and again 
we're really really happy to have Patty with  
us and it is just like a kind of family that 
we've built here and that's something I did  
a lot in the offseason with bu with Benji when we 
were building the team we wanted to have a really  
strong bond because you know you're together a 
lot um and that's like the core of our team we  
just want to be friends inside out uh inside the 
game and outside of the game so everyone gets on  
really well everyone learns everyone's eager 
to learn and everyone has the same mindset so  
I think that's all it is really and again like 
I said we're lucky to have someone like Patty  
being able to to come in and do such a good job 
yeah I was going add that like I don't think we  
wanted any problematic players and I think we've 
done exactly that um we've got a team full of  
people that are really nice just kind people um I 
think that does just genuinely help I think a lot  
of these teams that are doing badly uh a lot of 
it's due to like problematic players and yeah I  
think we've avoided that very well thank you 
we'll go to strafe next uh this is so anyone  
who wants to answer first of all uh you would be 
facing geni for the first time tomorrow uh first  
of all what are your expectations from the game 
also uh what what how big of a role would the map  
V2 Advantage play in tomorrow's game and do you 
think it's a disad disadvantage at all for you  
guys I can speak uh I think we're really excited 
to play against try like we've made friends with  
him since being here um you know especially with 
t show we've met him in ranked a couple times he's  
he's a very cool guy um I think the map video 
you know is what it is um I don't think we're  
going to think about it too much like sure they 
get to you know pick a sent probably or whatever  
like is what it is but you know we we know we're 
a strong team we can come back from anything so  
um I think if we just stick to our you know what 
we've done so far here what's got us here then  
you know I think it'll be a very good game and 
I think hopefully they will win thank you all  
the best for the future for tomorrow sorry oh 
good man uh we'll go back to Pedro for the next
question got a question for for Benji um as has 
been documented various times already either be  
before and even during this event you know you've 
had some time playing in fortnite just having uh  
one a few prominent events there and comparing 
that to now I mean given the fact that You'  
basically started from scratch getting trying to 
get noticed then uh building yourself up reaching  
tier one playing alongside uh these proper 
players and just getting to in an international  
Grand Final I want to ask do you feel making it 
to the finals of of this m do you feel that's  
better than like say making Grand finals of like 
any past fortnite tournaments given the road that  
you took uh up to this point um yeah it's a 
good question I I definitely think this is  
probably like the biggest achievement of my 
life so far um you know in fortnite I didn't  
you know I was making Grand finals but I wasn't 
winning anything Val is a lot different you know  
we've had to beat a lot of really good teams to 
get to this point um so i' would like to top it  
off with obviously winning the grand finals I 
think that would yeah that would be incredible  
but yeah it's definitely the the it clears 
it clears all the fortnite tournaments out  
played in the past nin was better okay fine thank 
you for the question we'll go next to nerditude
thank you so much I have a other question for 
neilo n I'm not sure about this info but did  
you only use one timeout in three months uh I 
think so yeah like to be fair um lot yeah yeah  
yeah like we were kind of ahead of it almost 
every time and I feel like something me and my  
assistant coach obviously it's not here right now 
uh something we wanted to focus on a lot was using  
the other coaches timeout is my timeout so we had 
you know I basically felt like I used them but I  
didn't so we made good use of the other coaches 
time out thankfully and yeah I don't really need  
to do much was was good nice okay okay thank you 
so much uh we'll go back to Pedro for the next
question i' got a question for Buu this time you 
know as as one of the the few people that remained  
from a 2023 Squad gotta ask you just where 
do you kind of see the the biggest difference  
from that 2023 Squad to now and have you kind of 
transitioned yourself in adjustments from that  
point to now and how do you think you you've been 
able to then you know play so well as a leader  
IG on just making your calls uh so far in this 
tournament um last year I think we had wrong team  
in terms of personalities I couldn't really show 
myself fully like the reason I'm calling well or  
the reason I'm playing well is because everybody 
trust me like whatever they they say they do and  
this gives like insane amounts of confidence so 
even if you're calling something wrong they still  
do it and because they're so good they still went 
around it gives insane levels of confidence and  
it feels like I know everything so like it's 
not just me it's like everybody and I think  
that's the biggest difference from last year 
thank you uh we'll take the in-house questions
next this is Esports focus and the question is 
for what your grand finals rival G performs Super  
well in this Masters and also you guys have 
in such good shape for the past two days how  
confident are you to take the champion trophy 
I'm taking my confidence from my team like we  
said we are like connected to each other 
if someone do like something wrong we're  
gonna do it together and win it so I have 
full confidence against ji and we're gonna  
send their home we're going home to s that's 
true okay anyway we will win because I think  
we are they are still good team I do respect 
them they are my friends but I think we are  
better like as a team so it's going to be 
hard match hardest mat we're going to play  
for I mean we play it probably but I hope 
we going to win it there we go I trust my
team uh here is question from Vil and want to ask 
oud and it's your first time come to the V Masters  
and you made it to the final we can see that you 
play better and better since the SP round and now  
every time you down clutch the audience will give 
you so much Applause so I want to ask that the  
Applause from the audience will give you a lot of 
pressure or it will make you be more excited in  
the game like I think we answer that like before 
like the stage like other things like phones like  
affecting us better like we are just getting 
hype we are also I think we have more FS than ji  
in here so uh it's going to be with us CR GNA be 
with us I think we're going to use it we're going  
to use it so well we will have so much hype and 
probably I will just stand up after every R okay  
thank you and I to bil and E first uh are there 
any more questions from the in-house media okay  
we'll go back to remote we got a couple more uh 
Elaine from one Esports hi So speaking of the fans  
a lot of the fans want to know the origin story 
behind your teddy bear hat Benji could you share  
with us whether there's a special reason behind 
this specific hat um there isn't anything specific  
but um I always really liked how Boer did like 
some cool walkouts and stuff and I'm I'm a little  
bosta Fanboy so um I wanted to have something like 
a little bit cool um so when I was in Berlin I was  
able to buy it at the like the merch store and 
you know I played league as well so and I like  
I like Tibbers so I thought it was a cool hat I 
was like you know what I'm just gonna walk out  
with it and it's kind of just stuck and the one 
game I didn't I forgot to bring it uh we lost so  
from from like now until I finished my career 
I'm going to wear the hat uh so yeah something  
like it's something like my sunglasses like yeah 
yeah it's like a good luck charm a good luck charm  
there's nothing nothing specific I just thought 
it looked cool so yeah it was a good question  
thank you awesome thank you we had a couple of 
questions submitted by uh the attending media  
that I'll read out now this is from the standard 
for Benji fishy um how confident are you about the  
match against jeni tomorrow um yeah I'm feeling 
really confident I think you know I was gonna say  
earlier but I think the fact that we've you know 
now played more games on this big stage than Ji  
is going to come into effect um I I feel like 
it's kind of the same as you know the Swiss  
stage where the first seed teams didn't have the 
experience on stage and that's I think kind of  
why you saw a lot of them do badly I think 
now that we've got more experience on this  
stage we know what it's like um is going to be an 
advantage for us and at this point I think we can  
beat anyone I think we're right now playing like 
the best team in the world um so yeah we're not  
scared of anyone and but yeah they're a good team 
it'll be a good game so yeah but I'm confident  
um the next question is um how do you feel about 
becoming one of the favorite pro players among Tha  
valerant fans me yes oh I didn't know that that's 
quite cool uh no I me I love it man I feel like  
every like International Event I'm okay Mar Madrid 
I don't think I made the best impression of myself  
um especially during the paperworks game I think 
I got got a few haters uh I I like to think now  
I've kind of cleared my name a little bit I'm not 
actually toxic um it was it was just in the Heat  
of the Moment um but yeah no I appreciate it man 
like I've gotten a lot of support just everywhere  
and it's really nice to see um it gives me a lot 
of confidence um and obviously my team you know  
I think we're all getting a lot of support which 
I think is very deserved like these guys are all  
incredible um so yeah I hope to um car on getting 
some more fans thank you and last question this  
is from the circles Thailand uh before competing 
in VCT did you think you would perform this well  
um you know I I knew you know when I first swapped 
to valerin I kind of knew what it took to get to a  
high level in orts um I knew how much time you'd 
have to put in how many sacrifices you'd have to  
do um so I was prepared for it I definitely did 
not expect it to come this quickly um I I kind of  
knew in my head I'd get here one day but I was 
thinking more like in like a fiveyear timeline  
sort of thing um but no I mean it's been it's been 
close to two years now like it's just under two  
years since I spped to valerant um so you know 
I'm super happy but no I didn't I didn't expect  
it right and we'll take the final question from 
nerditude hi this question is from Raquel fera of  
mice Esports and the question goes to Benji fishi 
after uh success in fortnite you are in the Grand  
Final of Master guy in bant how does it feel to 
be between the best gang and another competitive  
game uh yeah it's amazing man I mean like I said 
it before but like I didn't really expect it to  
come this quickly um it's it really feels like 
an honor because you know I was a big fan of  
just valerant Esports in general so getting to 
play against some of the players that I looked  
up to was it has been really really cool and 
yeah know I think I've kind of set myself up  
nicely for the future I think people know how 
good I am am now um and also how good our team  
is so yeah it feels feels amazing awesome uh I 
believe that is the last question Heretics thank  
you so much for taking the time to speak with 
us today thank you thank you thank you thank you
