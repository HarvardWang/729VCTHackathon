okay uh welcome back everyone uh 
we have here tic congratulations  
for your Victory guys today uh so now we 
are open the floor for question from the  
media please raise your hand and we 
call on you we are starting with P
Romero hey guys uh first off got to give my 
congrats to you guys for waiting today beating  
DRX and making the Inspire Arena I believe that's 
the name of the right name of the name still um  
got to send this over to mini boo first and 
foremost obviously you were very emotional  
after the completion of that series just want to 
ask you what was going on what was going through  
in your mind uh uh after that series ended were 
you feeling like emotions of Happiness were you  
feeling emotions of just relief that you were able 
to that you and the team were able to take down  
DRX or what do you kind of what do you kind of see 
in that I mean after the game I had zero thoughts  
in my head I just acted as my body instinctively 
would act I don't know I just was super happy um  
yeah like I just like let my emotions be don't 
care about the crowd don't care about that I'm  
getting filmed on the stage I just like no started 
jumping because that's how I feel and I huged my  
best friend tennis it was like I don't know I 
just I huged everyone like it was just very good
now uh we have another question from esep hey 
guys congratulations on the win my question is  
for Coach Neil Zeno so you mentioned in your Tweet 
after the win on how woot and mini Bo stepped up  
in terms of comms after some chaotic rounds can 
you elaborate more on that and how it helped your  
team close the series yeah I think uh said it in 
the Tweet as well right me Weber Nicholas we're  
all like really proud of everyone in the team 
but obviously um I think Dommy minu and and W  
were putting a lot of pressure on themselves 
the last couple of days um and it would have  
been very very easy to give up I think under the 
circumstances like we had lost so many [ __ ]  
rounds I'm not going to lie I can't think of a 
better word to describe it and both uh mini Bo and  
wo like really really took charge of their micr 
plays of the coms keeping our fundamentals good  
and making sure that you know after we lost that 
pistol round I don't think we had any other poor  
rounds and there was a couple of just like really 
really strong micro plays by both Dommy and W and  
to be Hest the whole team stepped up but those 
two especially just because they had so much  
more pressure put on I think by themselves so I'm 
really really happy that they could power through  
it and yeah they they they played incredible very 
good thank you thank you so much and good luck on  
your next match thank you thank you thank you 
uh we have one question here in the room sorry  
do you want to add something oh no no ah okay we 
have one question here in the room hello congrats  
on the win so coach yesterday you talked about you 
know what an incredible Year you guys have had so  
far already and the only thing that you guys need 
to do today is to have fun so first question guys  
have fun answer please yeah I mean I had fun but 
I didn't at the same time I don't think any of  
us had fun in first map and second map we had 
fun going lie because we were farming and the  
third map was not fun because there was some uh 
[ __ ] rounds by us you know like the wiper round  
one V4 or something and then pistol round which is 
kind of unlucky unlucky I don't know I don't know  
I mean we didn't have fun a lot yeah that's it I 
I think we played with confidence though I think  
that's the important thing like we weren't we 
didn't get scared after we thr rounds so yeah I  
remember like we throw like these two rounds and 
it was like 1110 it was like 1v5 and like ands  
was laughing or something I was like no stabilize 
discipline let's play Focus laugh after the round  
you know like oh yeah I I wasn't going to let the 
one if I lose like I was I was talking tkey is I  
was like doing some you know jokes in Turkish and 
he just screamed to me like he shut the [ __ ] up  
you can't yeah yeah like we I just stop it was war 
it was Battle thank you for your answers thank you  
uh we have one question from uh Andres H hi good 
evening I am the from Prince exports my question  
goes to mini we know that many people have CRI 
you for your performance as a doist but today you  
have overcome a bar that you may not be aware and 
you have ended up being the MVP of the match with  
uh plus 19 in kills how did you prepare to perform 
this way and also if your teammates and staff want  
to dedicate a few words to you uh I didn't hear 
the last part but I'm going to answer the first  
part and then you can repeat it so like after Le 
on game I was like thinking what should I change  
what what I should change in my routine what 
should I do like what What's the Difference Maker  
and I realized that I just had to do like every 
day I did I woke up I go to the gym I eat I have  
fun with my friends we prepare listen to music on 
my way to the venue I didn't do anything special  
I just do like my routine that I have and like 
the consistency and like I don't think I played  
bad earlier I don't think I like that's something 
like specific and just I I'm just trying to play  
my game every game as like I can and that's yeah 
I mean this the second part of the question was  
did any of us have any other words for you about 
it yeah the thing is it's not like Man Bo played  
bad before and now while he's playing good he 
always plays the same like he does what has to be  
done what I say what coaches say strategies set up 
whatever and that's it like he he always does his  
job and stats is just stats stats are for people 
who don't understand how the game works and yeah  
I think he didn't step up or anything he he steep 
up with coms and stuff but the kills they're kind  
of irrelevant like as long as somebody gets the 
kill it doesn't matter who gets the kill so yeah  
yeah I think what Anna says like has said before 
like if one of us is on top of the leaderboard  
it's because of dummy like um he's very selfless 
of all of us huh it's because of all of because  
of all of us yeah but I mean you're going first 
so he like doy is very selfless as a jewelist um  
he's not caring how many kills he has he's not 
caring that he's going and dying like being the  
beta like for the whole team like he doesn't care 
um which I think some Duelists do um even in VCT  
so yeah I was doing actually yeah prime example 
now I'm joking but I know there's a lot of like  
people that would care about that I think um 
care a lot about what other people think you  
know our stats are [ __ ] what it doesn't matter 
like doy does his job for the team and that's  
you know that's how we play and I think he does 
it like as good as he can thank you boys anyone
else okay uh we have one question call from
P yes uh I'm going to send it over to mini Benji 
fishy I'm going to move over to uh start of second  
half in ice box there is a 2v one situation 
against flashback where he pulled off that  
diffuse we want to ask you just what happened 
you know within your POV what went on and what  
do you think led to that and in addition to that 
despite suffering that uh result you guys were  
able to post back come back from 95 down to 
come back and so um first off first part what  
was going on in that play and the second part is 
um what enabled the team to bounce back despite  
suffering that play if you want I can start from 
what happened from my POV okay you start I'm going  
to build up on that okay what what happened was 
I mean I I called for doy to play first so I was  
just like I I I don't think I said a word after 
that I was just like yeah you you play first um  
that that was for my POV I mean I'm not goingon to 
lie flashback has some balls to stick that diffuse  
okay like I don't know I just uh I I don't I don't 
know like that was just like it was unfortunate  
unfortunate technical error you know like we don't 
talk about this but we are going to remember this  
for the rest of our lives like after 10 years 
I'm going to remember that moment and I'm not  
going to like repeat it you know yeah and I think 
after the game we like we just had like we we all  
knew it was like a like really troll we all knew 
how important it was to win that pistol um and I  
think we just did a really good job of keeping a 
good me like mentality um like we stayed I mean  
like this ice box we had so many bad rounds like 
T rounds so the fact that we stayed like strong  
mental is kind of what I think won us the game 
um like the fact that we still had good coms  
after this I think this team like where it was in 
Shanghai was like previously I think we would have  
just broke down in terms of comms and everything 
like that so the fact that we stayed playing like  
ourselves I was really happy about yeah that one 
three like three of us had like average of six IQ
uh I think I'm making it 
lower you know like are 76
so okay thank you for sharing that with 
us uh so we have one question here in the
room hello guys congrats for ZN I'm not 
going to ask what you ate for breakfast  
because it's hello guys uh so my question 
is to bu uh DRX um complemented how fast  
you adapted today to every situation so I I 
was kind of curious is it like all props to  
you or like is it the whole team was like 
giving ideas and uh what was the process  
like when you were discussing how to play 
each round and how to um react to certain
situations I would say it was 5050 on the B not 
much adapting on Sunset I think it was like they  
mostly played our rounds which worked well um yeah 
I was calling a lot but on ice box especially on  
defense and there's not much I can say I know 
they're going to come be so they sorry I know  
they they're going to come a so I'm like get 
ready a but that's it you know everything else  
what happens is up to them how do they defend so 
I'm just sitting silent because there's nothing  
I can do so it was a lot up to everybody else and 
on attack two I was like calling where to go but  
that's what Neil meant like I'm saying where 
to go but they're saying how to go like which  
utility to use What's the timing maybe B some 
utility maybe this that so like that's where I  
mean that's how it should work right I'm I'm like 
managing the micro but then they are managing the  
micro details and I think they did really well 
like they like it wasn't only me that adapted to  
how they play it was also them like they saw last 
round they defended like this so let's do this um  
so it was like 50/50 it was you know everybody's 
brain was working in this game great teamwork uh  
and my second question is about the next round 
uh what do you think about your next opponent  
this is a question to anyone I heck can love 
Dan I I mean for me like uh I mean in Madrid  
we lost to them and we haven't been able to play 
against them again so for for me and I think I  
mean we wasn't there but uh I for me I kind of 
like Revenge matches even though like it doesn't  
really mean much like we're still just going to 
play a game but like it's it's still quite cool  
to play against a team that we played against our 
first International Event and we lost to them so  
it'll be cool to see like uh how much we've 
evolved since then and my last question is to  
the coach uh what will be the preparation process 
look like uh in the nearest four days off day no  
off days no we'll definitely have an off day um 
we've been going for quite a while now so we'll  
definitely take a welld deserved rest um probably 
look over some of the games nothing too crazy and  
yeah we just need to get the balance right of how 
we prepare so nothing too crazy it's just another  
game in a bigger Arena so yeah we'll focus on 
ourselves and we go again but like Benji said I'm  
excited to play against Sentinels now with the the 
the fil roster so we'll get some revenge for Patty  
okay thank you so much luck thank you thank you 
oh okay don't worry guys we still have two last  
questions uh bro yeah so uh last question well two 
last question one is from Andres uh hi I have one  
more question for Benji fishi yes well we already 
know your next oppon is so your next opponent  
Sentinels and we saw a picture of you shaking 
hands with solsis do you have any message for  
him will you make him buy the tics bundle when you 
send him home uh yeah I think that's a good idea  
I think he's I mean with the amount he promotes 
The Sentinel bundle I feel like if we if we win  
he's got to promote the herotic bundle we've 
got to like we've got to at least have like  
a day or two whereas else is just committed 
to promoting the the heric bundle and if if  
they win then I'll promote the Sens bundle so I 
think that's a that's a good idea I still need to  
Revenge because in the Madrid we had a bet with 
and we lost and I had to buy Sentinel bundle so  
he has to get that atics bundle I promise that 
I'm going to take revenge okay and we are going  
to do it thank you very much and by the way I want 
to say to Sala see you see you at the gym in the  
match thank you thank you oh that's a challenge 
okay uh we have one last question from Pedro
yeah I'm going to send it over to to woot um Neil 
said earlier on in the press conference about how  
uh you kind of dealt with your mentality and how 
are you able to to to to adjust and tribute to the  
team in a in a winning fashion I I'd like to know 
for you if you'd want to elaborate exactly um how  
were you able to just deal with your mentality 
and how bad it might have been and and take that  
to today where obviously you and and the rest of 
the team played very well to end up Victorious  
yesterday uh my wrist was completely gone like I 
some I have some health problems uh today actually  
I got like two pain kills I think yeah I got two 
pain kills but it still hurts like um I just yes  
after yesterday night I just think it's all in my 
head you know I just think okay there is nothing I  
can lose anymore this end of the way and I played 
rank until 4:00 a.m. last night uh I think it's  
like help a lot because I just understand Sol 
my like sometimes I can control sometime like  
it's there's a control controllable things and 
uncontrollable things and I just control what  
can I control nail talk with me before the match 
I for the uh I think he's the one of the best on  
his job he's really going he's he's giving really 
good mental support because he had experience so  
I think it's like they'll help me also I just 
think this all it's all in my head and I played  
ranked and it's helped me a lot but I want to 
add one thing to that I think what would did in  
ice box like a late part of ice PX was I don't 
know like it's it was the most important thing  
because if like I'm not going to tell you what he 
did but basically his comes if he didn't come that  
good we wouldn't be able to win probably because 
his calls were like really efficient you know he  
was 200 taking yeah amazing call and like he 
just I don't know he just win us the game with  
minu I would say both of them were like really 
strong mentally they didn't gave up or anything  
think they just play their game and um they were 
really nice com wise thank you we all win together
brother okay uh thank you now thank 
yous for sharing your son experience  
congrat again on your Victory thank 
you thank you thank you a lot thank you
