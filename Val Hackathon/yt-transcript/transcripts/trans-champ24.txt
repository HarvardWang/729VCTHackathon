welcome back everyone for the next segment we 
have here uh Sentinels so congratulations guy  
for your Victory thank you thank you thank 
you now we are going to open to uh the room  
for some question from the media on the call so 
Fernando thank you very much hi guys Fernando  
from gameren Brazil congratulations on the win 
my question goes for zes uh Jordan since you've  
been participating on the press conferences 
so far with EDG fanatic I want to ask you uh  
if you ever retired from valerant would you 
become a journalist since you've been joining  
us uh no definitely not I think I'd get fired 
pretty quickly um I think I just get away with  
what I do because I'm a player um but you know the 
the journalist job is definitely way harder more  
thoughtful and everything than that and I think uh 
I think the journalists do a great job especially  
you guys shout out you guys out here in front of 
me and you included um but no I just like to have  
fun with it but thank you you could be like Billy 
Mays but for different teams bundles they have to  
pay me okay but I'm down thank you very much 
guys good luck thank you thank you so much uh  
next question is from elu thank you very much my 
question is for who want to answer which team do  
you like to face in the next stage have really 
be DX before how you would you prefer to team  
herck and the next round left or rematch against 
adg uh I mean multiple people can answer I guess  
uh personally I think I mean both teams are good 
I don't think we I don't think any team would be  
like less of an oppent I think it would be cool 
to play the rxs in a 50k back arena in Soul and  
uh turn it into a library maybe wow bro you're 
so hard that's crazy wow did you just get chills  
no uh I think it'll be fun I think there will 
be a lot of s fans anyway but I think it would  
be fun to play against Korean team yeah thank 
you very much for the answer all three teams  
I'd be really excited for like any of them just 
be really excited for be down to play heretic  
so be every team in the tournament Zeus you 
are old and fat why do we keep call this this  
big bone you guys see how they treat me over 
thank you so much uh next question is from
Rish I'm still not over Zack Collings El's F 
that's crazy uh hi guys R from Canada I guess  
uh firstly uh once again uh another really big 
Dove as per usual a well needed one might I add  
as we stay alive in the tournament once more 
giving me a heart attack every day thanks you  
all uh my question is actually uh is is has 
been more interesting it goes over to uh uh  
to to Z intense now to both of y'all look you 
guys are famously crowned as the Tekken do as  
it's called right but you know there's a lot 
of comparisons there's like there's back and  
for so I want to get some clarification out of 
three iconic Duos what I would love is if you  
both would clarify which ones both of you 
are the rest of the team can feel free to  
interject can I answer before you even list 
them you know you know what Zack let's see  
which ones you think they are go ahead I mean 
I was just going to say Shaq and Kobe that's  
my only answer I say yeah but here's the 
thing here's the thing okay so autter Shack  
and Kobe which Shack which and Kobe and 
also SpongeBob and Patrick and the Mario  
pick Shaq and Kobe k k which one are you Zach are 
you Shaq or you Kobe I think I'm very obviously
Shaq you can tell he has a great post game and 
bad free throws I just flow really well in the  
post I've got really good hooks really good like 
I I just have good footwork you know what I mean  
okay all right so in server time it's definitely 
SpongeBob and Patrick and Tyson is Patrick yeah
yep that's awesome you know what that works thanks 
guys appreciate it thank you uh next question is  
from Ria uh hey everyone this is Ria from Jinx 
uh first of all zis thank you for all the kind  
words for all the journalists uh now my question 
is uh from Kaplan yesterday against EDG the day  
didn't went trade for the team but today sorry 
uh the team improved and um had a great first  
and third map basically all maps I just want to 
know how did you guys change um the strategies  
and what exactly did you guys work on to get the 
result that you wanted in the lower braet today  
honestly I think the win more than anything is 
just a testament to us cleaning up our own like  
internal stuff as a team and our atmosphere 
and matches right we had a long talk after  
the loss yesterday about needing to work on our 
resilience and um basically just everybody taking  
ownership over the team and the atmosphere 
and holding kind of holding holding it up  
when we start to slip which I think has been a 
hard thing in the past yeah long conversation  
about um working on that uh among other things 
but for me that's the biggest one so we did a  
really good job with that uh in terms of strategy 
we obviously mixed up our Sunset but other than  
that I think today is a testament to the guys 
being incredible teammates and just staying  
strong because we didn't have a lot of time to 
prepare and bring in a ton of strategy and uh  
we definitely had to wing it a lot today and 
everyone did that especially uh John I think  
it's a lot of pressure for an igl to call in 
games where there's not a lot of preparation  
and time and he did an extraordinary job with that 
today um thank you so much and congratulations on  
the win and good luck for the next game thank 
you thank you we have uh the next question is
from hey guys likewise congrats on the W uh 
got a question for for John uh KL a little  
bit alluded to it just now in the in his most 
recent answer but I want to ask you from your  
perspective how difficult it was to just kind 
of be in a match like that because like on top  
of just the things that that uh the that you 
guys and also the the media people have been  
asked have been talking about within this series 
I mean from my point of view it's been a pretty  
like um streaky kind of Series in which one 
team goes well do does well in one half other  
team does well in the other half next half the 
same kind of pattern continued so I'd like to  
know from your point of view just exactly how 
difficult was it was and what was the kind of  
thing that you had to do in order to just kind 
of navigate yourself through that um this kind of
series uh yeah after uh EDG yesterday we just 
made sure to not repeat the same mistake and we  
just made sure to keep like reiterating and like 
talking like boy stay in it it doesn't matter  
like there's going to be a like they'll give us 
a chance and there's going to be a chance where  
we can shine and like that's what happened kind 
of on Sunset on attack where we uh just kind of  
just had a bunch of good rounds and we just kept 
going and going and going I think we had a great  
comeback uh buying same thing we uh I think the 
attack have could have been way better but we  
just made sure to stay in it obviously defense 
didn't go that well it's a hard map to play on  
defense and uh Lotus we need like Lotus is just 
our map as long as we like do the proper thing  
that we've always been doing which is like making 
sure we trade listen to the calls do our defaults  
right like just make the simple stuff and yeah 
just like after every round like on free time  
just like everyone stay in it we're good we're 
just going to keep going and uh I think as scap  
said like we didn't have much time to prepare 
we did like have a lot of plans and like how we  
want to play but the biggest challenge today 
was like more the mental aspect of the game  
and I think we showed up on that thanks so 
much uh we have one question in the chat is  
R score is for is congratulation on your win this 
question is for sis uh you might meet EDG in the  
semi-finals just that you ask at K can if equ 
Will boy he will buy uh your bundle so now we  
want to ask you will you buy edg's bundle um if 
we rematch EDG and they beat us a second time  
then they earned that me as bundle not zelus 
me as bundle they earn me buying their bundle
yes okay thank you uh so next question is from uh 
see that uh hello guys congrats on the win uh this  
question is open to anyone uh on Sunset we saw a 
return to the old team comp that you guys hadn't  
shown since mares Madrid uh was there any like 
uh thought process behind it was it because it  
was the elimination series it was tried and tested 
comp or was it something just prepared for fanatic  
or something that uh yeah I can take that one we 
had a tough Sunset yesterday and we're playing  
the next day whereas fnatic had a day to watch 
us play um it's h we could try to fix mistakes  
we have overnight or we can switch to something 
that will throw them off they'll presumably have  
zero prep on it for the more tired team presumably 
because we're just playing the next day U and we  
just went for it we were just in a spot where we 
needed to throw them off and I think all these CLS  
are good and we can win and lose with any of these 
comps so it you know what will we do in the future  
who knows but in this case it was a no-brainer to 
throw them off all right thank you and good luck  
in the next game thank you thank you uh we have 
one question in the room hello viia from nerud my  
question is for T um fbx player ay said you used 
to be his reference for training using your sense  
and Crosshair and then we have foxy9 who also 
has said a lot of times that admires you how  
does it feel to be at this point in your career 
where you are going against player players who  
are basic who basically develop their play style 
having you as a role model yeah I think overall  
it's pretty awesome um I'm just glad that I was 
able to be a role model for some of these players  
and uh being able to face them now on the stage is 
pretty cool in my opinion um I know growing up uh  
I had my own people that I looked up to in uh the 
gaming scene and Counter Strike in uh specific and  
I guess it's just kind of like paying it forward 
like trying to be a good role model um cuz I was  
mainly like looking at shroud before for like 
North American representation but yeah overall  
just it's it's really cool thank you you we have 
another question here in your hi everybody this is  
uh Jacob from capitals esports.com my questions 
for the whole team um you guys just had a huge  
game against fanatic it seems like anytime 
sentinals plays fanatic it's kind of like a  
big worldwide game uh now that you played them do 
you have anything to say to them or their fans or
org thank you Jensen for the question I think cap 
can can take this one excuse me the spot um it  
was a very good game and I was thrilled to play 
them uh always fun to go against my my birthday  
brother my twin uh Jake Minnie we have the exact 
same birthday I think he might be like 12 hours  
older so that was a big one for me uh obviously 
we needed to uh honor our lost soldiers that we  
competed with in lockin shout outs to uh briyan 
penaluna and Rory de Jackson we needed to win it  
for them Revenge forever in my heart yep yeah 
cool uh we have another question from Pedro
vomo heading into top four of this event 50% 
of that spots are acquired by America's teams  
yourself and latan I want to know um to anyone 
that that would like to answer what does that  
say about the strength of America's teams uh 
throughout this event the progression from the  
event from start to finish or start to even 
at this point uh from your point of view what  
do you think kind of makes that possible 
for um the region to perform well as of
now I can't answer someone else well um 
I mean I just think America is definitely  
the strongest region uh you can tell like 
even when you watch the regular season like  
there's so many strong teams and I feel like 
outside of this top fourward that qualified  
I think even other teams if they made it to 
Champs they would have made a lot of noise  
and I think even like the fifth seed or six 
seed would have like done a lot of damage in  
Champs that's why like uh all Americans teams 
that come come out to like Internationals are  
just usually strong because uh like we 
get a lot of good like scrim practice  
and prep in uh in Americas and we get 
pushed a lot and also Jordan you want  
to say something except 100 thieves because 
they have the pig they would have went last
fcks thank you uh next question is from
Rabia um hey everyone once again

from yeah we have one question here in the room
yeah hello guys congrats with the win my question 
is this Dy um coming into the uh finals comparing  
it to two years ago um how have you changed as 
a player and as a person and how has like uh  
the experience of last year changed you and your 
perception of uh playing in the finals changed  
a lot actually as a person I changed a lot um 
I used to get so stressed and so anxious about  
stuff I always tell Jordan that I see my myself 
at him he's always stressed about matches about  
PR and I understand him completely even like when 
he tells says bad thing to me I was like okay it  
was like me on 2022 and now I feel like with all 
the experience I have I'm more like I'm capable to  
lead more and be like a reference to the team and 
show more calm specifically in like some matches  
especially in playoffs and yeah I feel like I 
think that's it I changed a lot but I'm still bald  
that's it okay thank you so much and good 
luck in the next round thank you thank you
