uh welcome back everyone uh for the 
next segment we have here uh paper  
Rex uh before to start uh thank you guys for 
being here I know that is not a good moment  
and thank you for sharing here your time 
with us now we will start with questions  
from the media on the call so remember uh 
please raise your hand uh I will call on you
uh yeah there is go uh Pedro
Romero got a question for Alex um obviously 
looking at the entire series overall um you  
guys started off well on the first map Victory 
then things started to go uh south from the  
second map onwards I asked to you um when did 
what was the biggest issue that affected the  
team during that middle stretch of the um of the 
series when did it happen specifically and how  
much did that affect the team's subsequent 
um showing at the latter stages of set
Series so so your question is um what happened 
right in second M basically basically biggest  
issues that affected the team from 
second match second match up onwards
I mean this this happens this happen a lot this 
year where we win the first map convincingly  
and the second map we are we over either 
overcompensate by being too careful or too  
aggressive I think this time we were too careful 
and we were try we just like we instead of just  
um loosening up and trying like to you know we 
have one up I think we can take a little bit  
more risk I think we try to reduce risk because 
we just don't want to don't want to lose you know  
and the side effect of that is you you become too 
beable and become too become too um careful and I  
think because of that you know we ran into so many 
stacks that we normally wouldn't like this is not  
um this Sunset game was not the not not the best 
performance that we had normally we're a lot more  
we're a lot more confident on that map and the way 
we played the game just is is the way just going A  
or B because of that yeah you know that's how it 
roll sometimes and after that you know momentum  
is with EDG they came with a combat we've never 
played before even though we did some research  
on it it's still hard to play against like on 
the Fly um yeah and just do sto and that's what
happened than you so much uh next question is
from Hello uh s just uh freelance um my 
question is also for Alex unless someone  
else thinks they can answer it better um you 
went back to a Lotus composition from map 3  
that you had not run since Master Shanghai 
uh what was the reason for that and do you  
feel like that change affected the team 
performance on map 3 in any particular way
maybe I mean maybe maybe not enough reps 
but I think um we played it we played okay  
in scrims you know I think sometimes I think 
uh I don't know I don't know I think I think  
we would have been the same no matter what I 
think we were we lost mentally there rather  
than rather than compo you know we're making 
too many like uncharacteristic mistakes we we  
have certain like protocols do we W following or 
doing cuz we're trying too hard you know so it's  
like the opposite of map two more more than 
a comound like instead of map two we're too  
careful map three we're too aggressive so that's 
how that's what happened basically thank you  
on commiserations in the loss thank you thank 
you uh we have more questions in please V you
can ah we have one question here 
in the room I think no h yeah
oh hello I'm vi from nitude my question is 
for the uh this year we can say paperex has  
had lots of ups and downs what would you say is 
the biggest thing you've learned from this 2024
season uh I
think probably a lot of teams are getting so much 
better I guess compared to last year I think last
year it was easier I think to not really to beat 
them but like to kind of like maybe read them and  
punish them with the Trap and stuff but I think 
this year people are getting so much SM like a  
lot of teams so yeah maybe I would say those 
thank you thank you for your answer uh next  
question is from SAR hello um s I'm Mr freelancer 
uh I'd like to ask this question to Alex on map  
2 uh Lotus we saw you take uh two quick timeouts 
within like three to four rounds uh it did bring  
you guys some maps on the uh rounds on the board 
but I'd just like to know the thought process  
behind those uh back toback like rapid timeouts I 
we're just trying to calm down anything else and  
the first the first time I was was to trying to 
figure out what we can do about this a a side I  
think I told him the wrong thing I think we 
should have we should have played a little  
bit more defensive but I told him to go and 
try and fight them and I think that was that  
pretty much cost us the game I think let him run 
away with it okay thank you next question is for
alomo I want to send this over to forsaken uh this 
time given the fact that you know this is the this  
was the sixth time that you guys face off against 
EDG I want to know for from your from your eyes  
what was the biggest challenges that EDG threw 
upon you guys for this occasion uh and how that  
kind of affected the team's um showing today what 
the first question again yeah um given the fact  
this is given the fact that this is the sixth time 
you guys face EDG in the Rivalry history what were  
some of the challenges that EDG showed to you guys 
that made it that that affected the team team uh  
performance today yeah I think I think about the 
DG is today I think they just I would say last  
time we were crazier than them but now I think 
they just become more crazier than us and we we  
got more like a lot of pressure towards their play 
style I would say and I think about maybe Lotus  
it's is the com is like it's so strong I would say 
and they got us like a lot of like trap and stuff  
and we just can't handle it well I would say but 
yeah I mean EDG I think overall they are they are  
really strong team they come from a strong region 
so um I can't say anything but they they well done
today thank you so much uh next question 
is from c fby yeah uh just SI freelance  
my question question is for Jing uh you 
thought at the end of last season youed  
to take an extended break for your military 
service but you got to come back and continue  
competing with PRX uh how did it feel getting 
to continue competing the season and overall  
how do you think the season went as a result 
getting to maintain the core I mean I think  
it was definitely great that I managed to come 
back but I think overall this year we didn't  
do as well as we wanted I mean even though 
we qualified for every single event but like  
we could have played way better but I guess 
yeah this year is just uh not our best here I
guess okay thank you so much uh 
we have more questions in the
call okay uh it seems that we don't have more  
questions in the call but we have 
one more question here in the room
