their Victory against 100 thieves uh we'll begin  
with some questions from the remote media and then 
move to the in-house media uh strafe would you  
like to start us off I'm [ __ ] strug yeah thank 
you so much uh first of all guys I'd like to say  
it was great game from you guys you guys look you 
guys look really strong on both the maps so this  
question is open to all the players and the coach 
do you think that 100 thieves couldn't just adap  
to your style of play like or or do you think you 
had the better strats like what do you think the  
secret was behind behind such a dominant match 
from your side or or do you think it was just  
a matter of confidence yeah you can answer CU I 
just lost the one onone with my headset so I have  
no idea what you said uh first of all we have 
better IG second we have better Co stuff I me  
better I I'm not gonna lie everyone is better like 
the the stuff we had preps like um it was mainly  
like buan bind and you know the coaches like it 
was really really good the anti strats and like  
preparation we had um so yeah I think it's very 
a lot down to them and we were just shooting  
well and obviously W was you know he's wo so all 
right thank you thank you we'll go next to Pedro
Romero youy guys likewise congrats on the victory 
a pretty resounding victory at that against 100  
Thief Squad uh that uh coming into this uh 
was look that as one of the the contenders  
for the title um well got to ask about Sunset I 
mean another dominant showing another W another  
uh victory in that MCH specifically just I mean 
question goes up to anyone that can answer what  
makes you guys just so dominant in that map for 
this year um do you want me to answer you I'm  
not going to give too much away on you know 
why we're so good on it but I think everyone  
just has a very good understanding of the map 
um I think we kind of like found the the best  
agents and it fits our players really well um 
and we already know kind of like what to do  
if someone tries to any any strs so yeah I just 
think we understand the map really well we have  
answers for almost everything um so yeah I think 
everyone just likes it it's comfortable for us
thank you we'll go next to nerditude
thank you so much my question is for Benji Benji 
on the first day of the master in the med day I  
asked you if you felt at uh dis advantage to the 
player change and now look how far you come how  
do you manage to overcome everything that happened 
and reach the final stage of the tournament um I  
think just the combination of everyone on our team 
is just incredible the coaching staff the players  
we're all in form right now and I think you can 
see it when we're playing um I think Patti has  
done a ridiculously good job um in adapting 
you know to us playing you know uh learning  
you know how we want to play obviously he had 
an idea um just from you know playing with us  
before but obviously we changed some stuff so 
I think he's done an incredible job and it's  
it's kind of been easy you know the fur we've 
gone in a tournament the better we've got and  
yeah I I don't see it stopping thank you so much 
thank you we'll go next to Morty from Sons of KS  
hello everyone uh congratulations on the victory 
today guys my question is for Benji uh Benji now  
moving into the next match what are those uh key 
points that you need that your team needs to keep  
in order like to get a win in the next match 
um I think it's just saying staying focused  
sticking to what we know after fundamentals 
we we know we're really good we know they're  
also really good but I think we know we can beat 
them I think we showed that we could beat them  
on the second match against them um I think in 
like on any other day we would have closed out  
the ascent game um but with we learn a lot from 
that and yeah I think now that we've we've played  
against them a few times we know how they play 
and I think that's going to be a big factor so  
yeah I'm feeling really confident thank you 
and good luck in the coming match thank you  
uh we'll go back to strafe eorts for the next 
question hi uh so again this question is open  
for everyone so and it's a bit similar to the 
last one so with your next match being against  
G2 you guys have already faced them once in in 
this tournament so how is the confidence level  
of the team for the matchup and how and what's the 
plan for that matchup if you'd like to share a few
words I can see I mean we face twice lost 
both times but I think on both games we  
we could have won we had advantages especially 
on second game um I think the Difference Maker  
right now is the experience we already got like 
losing that 11 too late um build us as a team  
um showed us that anything is possible losing 
huge comebacks is possible but also making huge  
comebacks is possible so yeah like that new 
experience uh combined with the fundamentals  
that we have when we play good fundamentally 
we're just me rounds like it's as easy as that  
so combining that like we play them third time 
and they're obviously a good team but like it's  
on us if we win or we lose and we're going to 
do our best to use what we learned during the
tournament all right thank you we'll 
go to Pedro Romero for the next
question hello yeah uh got a question for 
for Woods I mean just got to ask about your  
individual performance you know 5128 KD pretty 
good showing I might say but yeah uh just how  
do you kind of look at your performance 
and how did you how what made you play  
so well uh for you in particular I think I'm 
getting best support like in the world like  
my team is always helping me also our coms 
are helping me as well so I think we are  
countering them in a game plan and I'm 
just using that that game plan and killing  
them like that's why I I have good STS as a 
dualist I think it's all because of the my
team thank you we'll go next to nerditude
I have another question for for Benji yes this 
question this question is from a friend who has  
been following you since fortnite um how do you 
feel about returning to an international stage  
after your participation in the fortnite World Cup 
in 2019 uh yeah it's pretty it's pretty amazing  
man I mean during my fortnite days I wasn't really 
able to play on stage that much because you know I  
think my Prime was during covid so um it was all 
online so that was kind of unfortunate um but to  
be able to be back on stage I mean I think it's 
a dream for every player to be playing on stage  
stages like this so yeah man very very happy to 
say the least thank you so much thank you we'll  
go to azrey from go Su Gamers next thanks so 
much congratulations Gentlemen Just got a quick  
question for you now that you guys are are going 
into the the next stage of the master Shanghai I  
wanted to ask you guys what was it like actually 
playing in the Ben Sor like I mean the previous  
sors was a little bit smaller and now it's like 
you're facing like a even bigger audience did that  
like motivate you guys even further was that like 
did you guys have a lot more nerves could you just  
give me a little bit more on that if you don't 
mind I can answer if you don't want to I mean I've  
been answering a lot but I didn't play me at all 
okay all right um I think all of us were very very  
excited I mean I can speak for me personally I was 
a bit nervous I think I don't know I normally I  
don't feel nervous before games but the fact that 
it's an arena like this and there's so many people  
um yeah I think it's natural to feel B now um but 
I think once we got on stage you know and we heard  
the fans you know I think they were on our side 
which um we're very grateful for um I think we  
gained quite a few Chinese supporters while we've 
been playing this tournament so um yeah I hope I  
hope it's going to be the same for the next games 
yeah see you in next bil streams yeah bil bil  
streams let's go I mean if I can another bit uh 
I can see other guys when they play on the stage  
like this I think it feels for me that they use 
it as a place to show themselves like everybody's  
watching and they're motivated it brings them 
confidence and like they're just playing Super  
well U and showing themselves off so I think 
that's how they feel correct all right thank  
you very much gentlemen and all the best thank you 
thank you we'll go to Pedro Romero for the next
question yes this question goes to Neil um given 
the fact that as as it has been mentioned a few  
times already in this press press conference 
familiarity between you guys and G2 you know  
given the fact that you guys played each other 
twice beforehand and lost both times as at that  
how do you think that familiarity will play in to 
tomorrow given how you it will be a best of five  
and there'll be a lot more maps to play uh and a 
lot more maps to choose from uh compared to those  
P past two encounters yeah I think it'll be a 
really fun game and a very very good learning  
experience for for me for bu it's going to be 
a late night for us tonight um but yeah I think  
I'm just excited to play against them again um 
and for us it's a completely different game like  
honestly the last two games don't really count 
in my opinion like we we have the chance to have  
a kind of a fresh start and have another go you 
know so we got some stuff I mean we got a lot of  
stuff right when we put them last time I think 
that's fair to say um and we learned a lot from  
the reasons why we didn't win so yeah we're just 
going to focus on ourselves focus on our prep and  
take the lessons that we've learned already and 
we like I think it was bu that said earlier um we  
focus on our fundamentals and ourselves we've got 
a very very good chance of making it to the Grand
Final thank you uh we'll take a question from 
the room now you guys are so incredible today  
and I just want to know everybody was shouting for 
you did you hear the chur from all of the crowds  
of course yes we did oh of course we did it was 
so loud so many people's like it was incredible  
experience I think it's super cool when you make 
like a really good play or you hit a nice shot and  
you know you can hear it through the headphones 
like it it kind of gives you confidence so yeah  
I think we will up it really guys I didn't even 
hear anything in the game only impossible I could  
feel it from the watch's room as well and hear it 
so I think was just probably locked in it was Sol  
like everyone was shouting and it was so hype it 
was so nice and it's like first time I'm seeing  
something like this and first time being in a 
place like this so it was hyping but in game  
I I don't even remember that's okay I feel like I 
am I'm in the studium concer and I am singer like  
something like that yeah that's a good way to put 
it I've also never seen this kind of support like  
from any fan base before it's since say like 
people waiting outside giving the boys gifts  
like we go for a restaurant and there's just 
random people coming up to us like it's insane  
it's super nice so I don't know I'm just so happy 
that we've managed to make an impression you know  
someone give me sh milkshake yeah yeah yeah it's 
it's a wi Mano someone gave him a wingman with  
a milkshake he had it on stage today so yeah
