uh please use the zoom hand raise function if 
you'd like to ask a question and then we will  
call on you uh would anyone like to go first we'll 
start with strafe sorry about the loss it was a  
pretty close game the both Maps came down to the 
last few rounds what do you think was the problem  
today especially since you guys started uh very 
slow on the very slow on both Maps what was the  
problem uh what was wi wrong um I think we just 
weren't playing together as good as we normally  
do um I think my calling was also not the greatest 
um in certain rounds um so I think just a mixture  
of just not having you know really good team 
Synergy today and then them having pretty good  
team Synergy kind of owned us especially early on 
as the maps got like warmed up we started doing  
our normal stuff um still a little off but I mean 
it's fine we'll come back tomorrow and we should  
be a different team we we know what to do know the 
fixes y thank you can I ask a followup question  
sure uh you would face papx again tomorrow my 
FX tomorrow again in apack team uh what would  
you what would the plan like uh going to tomorrow 
because they are a team that's always a challenge  
to face for any team because they are so they 
last night they changed the comp just because  
they thought it's wrong uh what would be the plan 
B like facing facing tomorrow are you confident  
about facing them yeah I mean I'm sure we're all 
very confident in facing them I think we think  
we're the best team in the tournament so I mean 
of course we're going to be confident I play PX  
a bunch um in the last year and I know exactly 
how they play I'm very aggressive very they're  
gonna be a very rough team play against but as 
long as we just like stay to our protocols and  
you know just play together I think we do have 
the upper end yep thank you uh we'll go next to  
one orts um hi I'm elen from one orts and sorry 
for the loss um this question is for boo you  
mentioned in the previous press conference that 
you would be excited to face Jenji and now that  
you've had the opportunity to face them were 
there anything about them that impressed you  
or were they exactly what you expected them to be 
um be honest I think they did impress me a lot um  
in the server it felt like uh they were playing 
together well playing Just solid valerant and  
then a couple rounds um we did some really like 
interesting stuff like uh being very aggressive  
and thought a got us a couple times which is 
like normally doesn't happen to us I feel like  
anymore where like some player does like a very 
aggressive like Peak or very aggressive hold and  
uh like multis us I feel like that this doesn't 
happen nearly as much and it happened like three  
or four times I think against them so Props onto 
those players for like being that confident in  
this game um yeah I think they deserved it today 
over us to be honest but and I do want to rematch  
them very badly now and I think uh it'll go our 
way next time okay thank you we'll go next to  
grill news hi I'm sorry for the loss um what 
do you feel you were able to learn from this
match um I'd say like primarily just what it 
looks like when we're out of sync and we just  
have to spend our time B reviewing this 
one to make sure that we understand what  
exactly was uh making us feel out of sync 
in game um as long as we figured that out  
I think I think we'll be pretty solid against 
PRX obviously PRX has like a pretty aggressive  
play style that we'll have to be uh used to 
but I mean at this point if you don't know  
that PX is going to be aggressive then 
you're probably not watching valerant
so thank you are there any other questions for 
100 thieves in the room or from the remote media
uh gr news did you have one more
question no thank you we'll go to
strafe then sorry sorry I had to turn on my mic 
um yeah this question is for booo um for of all  
I wanted to extend commiserations in your loss 
and I wanted to further the question that my  
colleague asked on um the performance today and 
you mentioned that your calling wasn't the best  
I want want to ask as an igl's from an igl's 
point of view what determines good calling on  
a particular in a particular series what allows 
you or facilitates you to have good calling and  
what doesn't um I mean to me I just think I 
called a little too many rushes on ascent and  
maybe ice boox I think sling slow against them 
probably would have been a little better in  
certain scenarios um but overall I just I don't 
think I was communicating as good as I usually  
do um in other Series so it just I don't know 
exactly yet I haven't heard like my coms back  
but it just felt off to me so I'm sure it felt 
off to like my teammates so um just overall  
just I think it was just weaker calling 
than normal as well I see thank you very
much uh 100 thieves thank you so much for taking  
the time to speak with us 
today no problem thank you
