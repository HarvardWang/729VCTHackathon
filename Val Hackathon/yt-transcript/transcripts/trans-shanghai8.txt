hello we are joined by Heretics who are coming 
off of their match against G2 uh we'll begin with  
questions from the remote media first going 
to strafe thank you very much um hello yeah  
first of all commiserations and the L guys um 
I wanted to do s focus on where you guys were  
at your peak in this series which was obviously 
a sent 112 uh I know this is probably a sensitive  
topic right now coming off that loss but we 
saw U G2 start clawing the way back into the  
game and it start reach the Panic territory 
as they start close down the score line and  
we know how important it is the way you close 
out a map you know like sort of the end of it  
so did you guys feel pressure to close it out 
when did the alarm Bell start ringing for you
guys you want me to take it I mean obviously the 
closer it goes the more what you are that you  
don't have that many chances um but at the 
end of the time whatever like you just play  
around so every single round we played 
with the same goal to win it um to get  
to 12 and 13 so I think whether it was like 
112 the an that we lost or like some other  
rounds like in my opinion they were the 
same um and yeah that's it thank you very
much thank you you are there 
any other questions for team
Heretics uh Heretics thank you 
so much for taking the time to  
speak with us today thank you 
wait that's it oh [ __ ] okay
