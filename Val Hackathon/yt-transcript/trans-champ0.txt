hello uh we are back with the second group of 
the preent press conference we are joined by  
ASAS Cruz safe and Fang F uh please use the 
zoom hand raise function if you'd like to  
ask a question and then we'll call on you 
uh we'll start with Tong Tong from Billy
Billy um hi aspas uh this question is for 
you and there's no doubt that you're the  
most competitive player in the world 
at moment also we could see K and Mao  
have put out insane performance 
in the final uh I just wondering  
what do you think you guys beat uh what do 
you think you made you guys beat G2 in the
final um I think for the finals we 
played our game that was something  
that we didn't do the first time that 
we played then on the upper finals we  
played a more like scared type of game 
play normally we play more aggressive  
type of gaml on the grand finals we 
play the way that we normally play
thank you we'll go next to
Raquel for
[Music]
thank you uh we'll go next to
Ravish hey what's going on everybody uh quick 
question for r as well too uh just uh I find  
you've been at the top of the list for everybody 
as a duelist that you know that that's someone  
who you can that they can take in a one V one now 
on your and do you find there's someone who you  
think I might have some trouble here or it'll 
just come down to the day of on who you end up
facing uh depends a little bit on like 
the situation that I am in on the One  
V one because there are sometimes that you are 
playing a One V one and you are in disadvantage  
and things like that but depending on the 
situation I confident on myself because uh  
I think like uh confidence in this game is the 
most important Bon thing that you need to have  
cheers thanks man thank you uh we have a pres 
submitted question for Cruz uh Cruz uh this is  
from the valerin competitive Community how have 
you dealt with uh the mental fatigue that formed  
from The Season's General scheduling and recently 
integrating preey and preparing for Champs um it's  
it's been very tough for the past um the whole 
season basically and we've made many changes so  
during the time we put pry in the roster we 
didn't have a lot of time so we didn't really  
get to show much but I think it's I think they 
tried to give us quite some time already but  
the because of the changes we decided to 
make ourselves it kind of put us in like  
a bad spot at that time so I think that's all 
I it doesn't it's not the schedule from them  
that causes like you know All the Troubles thank 
you uh scyth we're coming to you next uh this is  
also from the valerin competitive Community um 
I remember in the past you said you didn't want  
to play dualist and you played Sentinels for the 
whole first split in the second split you became  
the main duelist of the team was it your own 
wish or the coaches and on which role do you  
think you can bring more impact to the team um 
I mean I don't really know we had some coaching  
changes I guess halfway in and it wasn't really 
something I thought about I mean role wise for me  
it's not that important whether it's Sentinel 
or doist or whatever it is I just uh think it  
matters what the team wants kind of at the time 
and I I was asked to play it again because they  
felt like the roles fit a lot more and it's not 
saying that my Sentinel is bad guess that's not  
what we're saying okay my Sentinel is okay okay 
to say the least but obviously on do have a lot  
more impact than I think was a joint decision 
on that yeah thank you so much um Alan we'll  
come to you with the next question okay thank 
you uh so this is question for f i I'll deliver  
the question first in English so uh for for sports 
this is a group full of you know debut uh so apart  
from laiton for Vitality for Balon there's 
a lot of uh rookie Who come out this season  
and have their debut in the International Event 
so uh I don't know uh do you think that uh in this  
group of rookies do you think that your team and 
maybe including yourself could perform better than
them safe vitality
so the answer from p is actually they think that 
their advantage is they have been together for  
a longer time compared to you know maybe 
Vitality maybe Talon and therefore uh they  
think they have better chemistry they can put up 
better teamwork so they think uh that is their  
advantage in this group thank you thank you so 
much Alan uh we're going to go next to Pedro
hey guys uh good to see yall uh for this press 
press conference I got a question for Cruz um fair  
to say it's been more than a minute since we've 
last seen you um qualify for an International  
Event you know the previous time being Champs 2022 
and back then when you were work sh I just want  
to ask you now that you're back in the stage 
with a different team a different set of guys  
surrounding you um how do you kind of compare 
your experience from back then to now and what  
do you think is the one thing that stood out for 
you amidst this progression for you in particular  
between set times um definitely my experience 
against um the na and EU Styles because having  
Fross coming in as our coach the way we play the 
game is very different and the way we approach the  
game is completely different to when I was in 
cersa so I think that's how we've been growing  
as a team and as a player for as myself as the igl 
knowing how to deal with a lot of the things that  
might come at me in this group so yeah that's how 
I think we We Grew From The Experience we had this
year thank you so much we'll go next to 
Elaine from one orts hi this question is  
for Cruz going into your first match against 
love do you guys feel any pressure at all and  
how does it feel fa facing America's first 
seed um I'm actually very excited to play  
against Lev because um we just got briy 
and I think he's gonna put up a good fight  
against aspes which everyone knows that he's 
a very good dualist even I know and everyone  
is saying that um he's the best player 
in the world which I also do agree but  
it's good for us to see where we are and to 
have him get the best experience as much as  
possible for his first International and his 
first game so I feel like it's going to be a  
very fun game it's going to be good experience 
for all of us as a team and hopefully we come out  
on top awesome best of luck thank you thank 
you we'll go next to Tong Tong from Billy
Billy for
[Music]
[Music]
uh the question for phone phone is actually in the 
group stage your first opponent is Vitality is a  
super like high status especially in EM region 
and actually they also uh qualifi for the grand  
finals in EM region and this time is your debut 
and what kind of preparation you think you have  
to done and no matter in the mentality or in the 
tactics and also what's your goal and F said I  
think our goal is the same as uh in the domestic 
competition tournament and I think we just need  
to like have a better counter strapping and have 
a better aning and winning every single round and  
stuff like that and we just want to play our own 
stuff our decent job and yeah that's all thank
you thank you we'll take the 
next question from Fernando at  
game arena thank you so my question goes for aspas
very go thank you thank you 
uh we'll go next to Tong dang
uh hello uh my question say from Vitality uh 
after your last performance in the B state in  
Champion 2023 what do you think about your 
CH to qualify into into a playoff with your  
team thank you so much um I think chances are 
good but only because I don't think we think  
of the playoffs or groups or we don't we don't 
generally think of like the the long term of  
things I think us as a team is like we like to 
treat everything very in the now very present  
we don't really think about like I guess the te 
game or the game after that or what happens when  
we get to playoffs or what happens if we don't 
make groups it doesn't really matter for us as  
a team so I mean in terms of odds I would 
say they're they're good but only because  
we're not thinking that far we're thinking 
what comes first and that's obviously key
thank you so much we'll take the next 
question from stra E Sports thanks so  
my question is for Fang so you know this 
is the first International outing for the  
team so how is the atmosphere in 
the team and also apart from the  
teams in this group are there any 
teams that you want to face in Soul
uh he said he really want to face against 
durker he think durker is a super powerful  
players and he also watched a lot of his 
competition in the pretty early days so yeah  
he think he's a super great player and he's 
super willing to have a match with with him  
all right thank you thank you we'll go next to
arnab hey guys uh I'm sorry am I audible 
yep go ahead H my question is for safe uh  
I want to ask you about uh at the start of 
the season when you guys came into India  
during convergence you had not a great start 
to the season but it was pretty dominant by  
you all had uh when I had chat with you 
during the uh event you all had one thing  
in mind that slowly and steadily you guys 
are trying to grow uh reflecting upon from  
the start of the season to the end almost to 
the end of the season how do you think the  
team has grown individually and uh personally 
you as well compared to uh last season to this
season I mean I think we've uh grown a lot as 
individ uals and as a team I think we worked with  
a lot of people along the way in terms of like 
people in coaching staff and whether that's mental  
or just the assistant coaches and the interactions 
we've had with each other I think and the matches  
we've had as well have like really formed all of 
us in a good way in a positive way uh we learned  
more about how to approach each other and how 
to deal with conflicts we learned a lot about  
the small things that upset each other and how 
how to avoid those small things uh and I think  
it's nice to have like a very um let's say like 
this time throughout the year like having defeats  
and having upsets and having whatever we went 
through together because it's really formed  
every single person to the people they are today 
and obviously we're in champs for a reason and  
I think uh all all of the lessons have led up 
to this so in terms of development I think uh  
it's pretty good for all of us thank you and best 
of luck thank you uh we have a question from the  
next okay this question is for USB you are the 
top one of the list of the entry kill and I  
just want to ask how's your feeling about that and 
what's your expectation about the whole journey of
Champs um if I would like say something uh 
is that we're going to like look at one game  
at a time so we're going to go by steps so 
first first we are looking at Talon so and  
like we as a team are just preparing to 
play against Talon so I'm not looking at  
the tournament as a whole but I'm looking 
at steps that you need to take so you go  
one step at a time so you can reach your goal 
thank you thank you uh we'll go next to wow
eorts
for the question is for aspas actually 
we can notice that L Von have a better  
perform and better status in recent days and 
especially like coms from maeno or yeah any  
players in your whole team and I just want 
to know like what kind of adjustment you  
made and which team or which like specific 
Pro players you want to meet in this
tournament uh I agree with the part that we 
made an improvement as a team uh as I said  
in a question before I think we are a lot better 
in the fundamentals like the basic stuff of the  
game so we made a very big Improvement in this 
part so we are playing better as a team than  
before and a player that I want to face um uh 
I always say Jing because I like him so Jing as
thank you we'll go next to Antonio Romero yes 
uh thank you uh my question is for sa you are  
the only player with uh experience in valerant 
champions from last year with Tim liquid do you  
think this is going to be helpful for your team 
and how would you manage to share your experience  
with your teammates I mean if it's going to 
be helpful I don't know uh I can't answer  
that really but I think that uh obviously you got 
to you got to let people experience it themselves  
and then you can warn them about the things that 
may or may not happen but at the end of the day  
it's it's something that they have to take on 
themselves whether it feels overwhelming or  
whether there's uh too much going on too stressful 
or you get sick or you get jetlagged uh you know  
I warn them about all these things and I tell 
them what could happen but yeah I mean obviously  
it it would help a little but at the end of 
the day they got to face things on their own
thank you we'll take the 
next question from nerditude
thank you so much my question is for aspas 
what can we expect from leang in this year's  
match against Talon do you think they have we 
have a boo from playing at home uh uh you can  
expect a very good match they are really good 
opponent and probably it's going to be a 21  
series for can be for it team and it's going to be 
a really good match so you can be like have High
Hopes thank you we'll go to Sky key next Okay so
the question is in your group like there is 
so many famous Duelists around the whole world  
and actually this is your debut on the 
International Tournament and obviously  
you play the same role like the Dess role in your 
team and you confident about to have like the same  
competition like the role and with your opponents 
and what's your expectation about your performance  
do you think is kind of like a test of your race 
and F's answer is I think is kind of because you  
know sa and ASAS there are super great dualist 
around the whole world and I think they are super  
like have have proess or something stuff like that 
and I really want to like have a match with them  
and I'm super looking forward to it as well thank 
you thank you we'll go next to Alan yeah thank  
you this is question for safe so uh I remember 
safe hi uh I remember that saw clip of you in  
your stream talking about you know maybe you're 
a little bit frustrated or a little bit burned  
out in the whole season right and maybe you're 
talking about that you are hited to you know  
about your career or role in in this in this team 
but uh I know that's a long time ago like you in  
your stream you're talking about that but uh does 
things change now like you revitalizes rejuvenated  
after the split two and you feel that uh you 
you are still well enough to continue your whole
career I mean um I feel a little rested let's say 
I only had three days so I don't know how rested  
I can be after finishing the the the playoffs 
and whatever but obviously I mean it's been  
very rough for me it's been very heavy um and 
it's not only because of ingame things I mean  
obviously we all have a life be be behind the game 
as well and we have things going on whether that's  
with the family or friends uh and just personal 
things obviously uh I had someone very close  
to me pass away as well and uh you know that was 
that was ticking on me as well when when we were  
playing so intensively uh but obviously I mean 
after qualifying to Champs and trying to push  
through um like the things that were going on uh 
I I do feel slightly more rested but I can't say  
that it's not weighing over me still okay thank 
you thank you um we'll go next to Pedro Romero
yes uh got a question for for aspas given off 
given what Cruz said about pry earlier on in  
the press conference I'm kind of curious 
on how you kind of view pry given his fast  
Ascent to this stage having played three 
matches in tier one this year to qualify  
for for Champions um for you how do you kind 
of look at a pry as a player and how do you  
kind of view his current form and also his 
potential you know later down down the line  
you know U within and also you know out Beyond 
uh Champions uh he's a really good player uh I  
watched a little bit of like uh clips of him 
playing rank highlights and those things and  
he looks like a really good player and he's 
coming from ranked as well when I started  
playing I got picked up from ranked as well 
so we come from the same place and he looks  
really good thank you we'll take two more 
questions uh Elaine from one sports hi this  
question is for aspas going into the tournament 
being deemed as the goat and best dualist in the  
world does this title add more pressure to you 
or does this boost your confidence for future
matches a little bit hard to say because I 
I don't like to look much at those things  
that are like outside I like to focus more on 
myself and my team so if I would like look more  
at those things I probably would say that it's 
like a confidence boost at least for me it would  
be but can people there's people that can see 
us more pressure as well I see thank you best  
of luck thank you and we'll give the final 
question to stra Fe Sports thank you so this  
question is also for aspas so the top seats from 
the other leagues have mentioned that you know  
playing so many games coming up to the final 
causes a bit bit of some stress and a bit of  
U mental uh wear as well so I would like to 
ask how do you guys as a team deal with this  
or do you even face these kinds of issues uh in 
America's playoffs we played four days in a row  
and it was two MD FS that went one for five maps 
and the other one for four uh you get like a lot  
tired during those days but for me saying myself 
I love playing and I love being on stage so even  
if I'm super tired I'm happy by being there so 
at least for me it's not a problem but like I'm  
tired but even like that I'm doing the best that 
I can and I'm really happy to be able to like play  
more games all right thank you so much and all 
the best to all of you for your upcoming matches  
uh to the players on the set thank you so much 
for taking the time to answer our questions today  
this will conclude the press conference and 
we'll be back with the next group momentarily
