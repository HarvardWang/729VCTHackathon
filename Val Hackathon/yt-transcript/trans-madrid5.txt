hey everyone welcome to the press conference 
we are joined by Sentinels who are coming  
off of their Victory against loud we'll 
start with a few written questions first  
first question goes to John cue from 
the valerant competitive Community uh  
how do you develop your game sense did you find 
Challengers to be a good place to develop those
skills uh I mean Challengers helped me a lot to 
grow as a player uh I think it helped me I mean  
challenges is a long season and uh we went 
through like high lows and other highs so it  
did help me to improve as a player but game sense 
wise just I think I watch and play the game a lot  
and uh I'm uh I'm a quick learner and I think 
fast so it's very easy to me for very easy to  
me to like kind of like guess what the opening is 
doing and kind of guess what they would expect me  
to do so that's how I approach it so it's pretty 
much just playing the game a lot and watching a  
lot thank you next question goes to Kaplan from 
the valerin competitive Community after coming  
so close to winning out ice box but losing it 
in the end what was the team morale like going  
into map three was there anything you or zelus had 
to do with bringing it up a bit I actually think  
the team especially zelis very especially zelis 
did an incredible job picking the moral up back  
in the middle of ice box so that's something that 
I'm really proud of the guys and we've been doing  
multiple times now when we're really really down 
the morale gets really low on a map uh we we pick  
it up in the you know late end of that map and we 
say hey win or lose let's pick back up and if we  
win great and if we pick back up so we can just go 
into map three and win great so really appreciate  
the guys especially Elis for that one makes my 
life easy because I don't have to try really hard  
to pick us up between Maps thank you next question 
goes to tens uh congratulations on taking out loud  
to the lower bracket how do you feel about going 
against Jen and going against Karen I think this  
match against loud was really difficult we 
always knew that they were a top team coming  
into this tournament so going forward against 
gen obviously we have a lot of confidence but  
can't underestimate them nonetheless because they 
are also a top team coming into this tournament  
and I know a lot of people were kind of putting 
the comparisons with like pens versus Karen so I  
guess we'll just see tomorrow what happens thank 
you this next question also goes to T from Juan  
Pablo Torres from Prince Esports your performance 
throughout the tournament has been incredible and  
today with Omen and the TPS was no exception do 
you think we are seeing your best version and  
what can we expect from you for the next games 
in one of your best tournaments so far I think  
this version of me definitely for teamwork and 
just creativity is the best version of myself  
currently I don't think I'm capped at this spot 
here and I think I can keep getting better as a  
player so I think everything is just a learning 
experience playing the tournaments um winning  
stuff I think is very important but also taking 
some losses here and then thank you we'll now  
move to remote media questions first question from 
Brandon thank you very much congrats on the win  
guys um I'll ask this to whoever I'd like to get a 
couple different opinions if I could on it um this  
match was the highest viewed of the tournament 
so far but you guys uh with three of the top five  
most viewed matches at Madrid so I just like to 
ask um you know if you even care about the views  
um you know what what it means to have those eyes 
on you as players uh as well as um you know why  
do you think so many views come towards kind of 
gravitate towards your matches we're bringing the  
train back baby we're Sentinels is coming back 
on the map um I mean we're I mean we're excited  
that like our matches are viewed very highly and 
obviously we want to win and we you know the more  
entertaining we are the more views we get the 
richer we get more bundle we sell more bundles  
we sell uh so I'm pretty excited but the train's 
coming back yeah I think uh I don't know I think  
it's fun to watch us and uh we have uh strong 
personalities and we also spend time outside the  
game to like build our brand which other teams 
don't and uh also it's thank to our marketing  
team that's sending Banger tweets on Banger 
tweets while playing the games so yeah also Den
zombie please buy the bundle please no not the 
bundle the Sentinels bundle The Sentinel please  
buy the Sentinels bundle thank you next question 
from strafe Esports hi guys so once again uh  
congrats on the win so this question is for all 
of the players and the coach so both you and Loud  
both teams managed to push each other quite far 
two maps going into overtime so even though you  
managed to win out the series where do you think 
you could have fine tuned a little bit a better so  
that you know you could have finished the match a 
bit faster bit faster to not have to go that extra
distance answer um I'll be honest it's hard to 
say like a unique thing that happened that we  
could like pull it back but to be fair both 
teams asn't low we were both like trying to  
adapt each other every round so even if 
was like 71 sometimes it didn't feel like  
71 because it was like so close rounds almost 
every round was like Clos on this series so I  
think like it's I don't know we played good 
L play good it was like really balanced the  
series so it's unfair to say oh what we 
could have done better so we could like  
get an easy M uh an easy series for us 
cuz it was never going to be easy prach  
man you're so well spoken oh my God okay God 
okay thank you thank you next question from
ravish hi guys uh firstly congrats again on 
the win uh I just uh wanted to ask quick thanks  
number one to Second uh Zach I want to say 
congrats on not killing your teammates today  
I find it was an incredible accomplishment 
a lot of fun to watch uh I would say you  
just just talk me a bit through like your 
adaptations going from match to match like  
now where you've I find you've played 
a lot more with the supportal with the  
utility that you're bringing in allowing 
you to set up for your team but also for
yourself uh I would say I just kind of come in 
and do my job uh I got to make space I got to  
get kills um I got to be able to support my team 
when I have to so it's just kind of about keeping  
consistency coming in doing the same kind of 
routine every day so that I can play just as  
good every day today was one of my worst days 
in the tournament but that's okay I still feel  
like I came in and did my job well and I'm just 
trying to just trying to do that as a d okay uh  
and just another quick thing was that uh I see 
almost most of you especially Zack and then sashy  
you're rocking some sort of drip on your chain 
so if you can talk me a bit through about your  
drip you got going on and if and and this goes 
of course to the whole team if you guys don't  
have trip why not what are you doing you want to 
go first than me go go first all right I got a I  
got a bracelet and I got a necklace both of them 
were gifts from my mom and grandma for Christmas  
um my necklace has St Jude on it my middle name

she wanted to have a kid so it's pretty important 
to me necklace is um bracelet is just kind of a  
bracelet I don't know it's a gift they're all

bracelet fit check engagement ring oh my God 
there's a house in there thanks guys appreciate  
it thank you thank you next question from parista 
gamer thank you um this is for T hi Tyson we saw  
the best game so far in these Masters how did you 
experience this game against lout and what do you  
expect tomorrow against gin I think I said this 
on an earlier question where I think the match  
is really close loud is a really good team that 
they're always able to adopt they have really  
strong Shooters so the match against loud would 
never be really easy and just the fact that we  
were able to overcome that and take the win at 
the end of the day kind of gives us confidence  
going forward to the rest of the tournament cuz I 
feel like if we can be loud we can be anyone and  
so we know that and we see that for ourselves 
so just moving forward I think we're we're  
confident thank you good luck for tomorrow thank 
you thank you next question from arnob the spike
GG hi guys congratulations on when my question 
is for t uh I was watching K's post stream and  
your Uncle Billy was there uh and uh you got 
to know that he was the one who introduced you  
to the gaming so how much impactful he has been 
in your life if you can share a little bit that  
would be great yeah so my my uncle my Uncle Billy 
uh he definitely showed me the counter- strike at  
first and that was like my first game that I got 
really big into competitive um but just for like  
out of game and uh in game I think he's just kind 
of like a role model of like who I looked up to  
uh and who I aspire to be so um it's really cool 
to be kind of like supported by who I looked up
to thank you next question from Raquel M Esports  
hey guys congratulations on the 
my question goes to sadak oh
Sak
for
[Music]
[Music]
for
next question from Sports ke to Esports uh 
hello everyone first of all congratulations  
on the win uh my question is for John cue uh 
you have faced loud three times already this  
year how has your experience been lling against 
such a veteran team has been Elling against such  
a veteran team and do the numerous face of make 
make it a little easier to call rounds against  
someone like sadak uh I like playing against 
L I think they push us to the limits because  
they're such a great team uh great individuals 
and obviously sedak is a is an amazing igl so  
it's always fun to play against them uh so far 
we're two1 against them and uh all three series  
have been super close I don't know I just 
I just think it's just big valerant right  
now s versus loud and obviously it's enjoyable 
uh the fact I think the fact we played against  
each other so much it just makes it harder 
CU just like a mind game because they know  
what we're going to do and uh they know what 
we're going to do so just like at the end of  
the day just mind mind games and whoever is 
going to show up in the day thank you so much  
thank you thank you next question from Julia hi 
guys congratulations for doing my question goes
to
[Music]
for
[Music]
next question from Fernando 
uh hi guys congratulations  
on the win my question is for Sassi
[Music]
VI
[Music]
[Music]
for strafe Esports so this question is for the 
coach so the next match is against gen so what  
are your thoughts and expectations going into the 
matchup and also is there anything that you think  
you might you could take away from today's game 
that would prove useful or beneficial in that  
matchup uh yeah I'm excited to play them I think 
they're a very different team from loud probably  
going to get more methodical game tomorrow Lou 
are brilliantly clever and team and they're not  
afraid to play in a way that can be confusing and 
chaotic whereas I think geni are more about being  
a bit consistent methodical drilled so I think 
it's going to be a hard game but a very different  
game and I'm excited for that kind of a breath 
of fresh air after what we just went through and  
as for takeaways from today well we don't have 
a lot of time but I think we did a really good  
job I think it was a really hard game and we 
persevered and obviously we're going to try to  
clean up a few things and look at how gen play 
but mostly just continue to play our game and  
trust that it'll get us across the Finish Line all 
right thank you and all the best guys thanks thank  
you Scott Esports thank you um I have a question 
here for Coach Kaplan um you mentioned earlier at  
this press conference um how vital specifically 
Jordan was to um sort of keeping the teams mental  
in a good State especially on icebox um you just 
want to expand a little bit more about the value  
he provides obviously the value he provides the 
organization and selling the bundle but obviously  
and in addition to that the value he provides um 
to the team's mentality and having a player like  
that who can keep Spirits High uh during tough 
Maps yeah I've never seen anything like it uh you  
know people say hey The Vibes Merchant obviously 
an insane uh you know Master marketer and a really  
good player very flexible but his intangibles I 
still don't think uh get recognized or appreciated  
enough which is understandable right people don't 
know what's going on behind the scenes I think  
everyone does a great job but Jordan really leads 
in terms of you know holding everyone accountable  
hey guys we need to wake up we need to stay 
talking hey we need to calm down here hey you  
know we messed up but we got to move on you know 
he's not afraid to call anyone out or call the  
team out on things we need to do better and then 
simultaneously he he's able to say hey let's keep  
moving forward whenever we're getting frustrated 
he he puts so much effort into the team atmosphere  
and how the team and people individually are 
feeling and really brings anyone back if they  
start to slip and we would not be here without 
him I love you Jordan thanks man I was recognize  
you thank you I know I love you guys can I get a 
followup from zelus about uh your thoughts on me  
your coach's words just there um I mean I just 
want to be the best player I can be like for my  
team team like I just want to win it's always been 
like my goal obviously um I Vibe well with the  
Sentinels organization and they kind of understand 
me as like a person and a player um but I mean I I  
truly believe like as a team you need five people 
who want to win and like give their all especially  
like our coaching stuff as well like everyone here 
cares a lot um so I just always want to like come  
on Match days like and make sure I'm like the 
best I can be for like not only myself but like  
my teammates like if they're having a bad day or a 
bad game or something it's like fine cuz it's like  
if you're still doing your job like you're you're 
going to win either way like you're not you're not  
going to solo win games in valerant um I mean yeah 
that's like and so just like the least I can do is  
like you know be like emotionally supportive for 
my team make sure like all our boxes are checked  
everything like that um but at the end of the day 
it's all a team effort what do you even do shake  
some ass and sell some bundles BL it he sure does 
thank you thank you are there any onsite media
questions hi this is L for mgg French um media 
my question goes to zelis uh sometimes being the  
clown of the team the one who is like carries 
the mental aspect and make jokes and can be  
difficult when you're yourself sometimes tilted 
by the game so is it something really natural for  
you to do or do you did you actually work on 
that uh I've definitely had to work on it um  
I I'm human just like everyone else and I get 
frustrated just like everyone else um but I've  
understood like my role as like a player and like 
you know I'm not old but as I get older I'm gonna  
have to move from you know kind of more into a 
leadership role um and obviously like cap has  
helped me a lot with that um I had the benefit 
of learning very quickly last year as well and  
I think like every game I just get better and 
better um every week we play I get better and  
better as like a leader and stuff like that so 
um yeah I've definitely had to work on it and  
I'm sure I'm going to keep working on it but 
definitely was not uh I used to not be like  
that always I used to be a little bit of a a 
rager um but no yeah I'm still coming around  
I still have my days where I get pretty pissed 
and the guys you know they accept me for who I  
am so it's great um but I think we just all want 
to win and I wouldn't I wouldn't want to do it  
with anyone else so thanks for your homest if only 
me it anyone that wants to ask a question please  
come up say what I want to say right now to come 
please sell more bundles sell more bundles [Music]
bundles um hello congratulation for the win H 
the question is for sassin the first time is  
because you play with versus loud two times in 
this month and maybe you can play again in the  
tournament ER and the question is if the match 
is special for you because you have a a teammate  
in the thir team and you have situation like the 
clutches no is a special for you and have a extra  
motivation play play versus you older teammate 
I'll be honest I always think about that like  
before I going to the match but in the end of 
the day like doesn't matter it's like it's just  
a bonus you know oh we're playing against l oh 
oh cool we we win against them it's my ex team  
but the the end of the today we just want to 
win master we just wanted to win kickoff so if  
it was on any other team I would play the same I 
would feel the same um for Kaplan ER the question  
is because you play versus geni and you play in 
the last matches versus me and and now Americas  
er do you think that is more difficult prepare 
the match versus the Pacific teams because they  
have a more aggressive player style or different 
composition uh depends on the team I think Pacific  
is a really interesting region right now and 
um because like a team like paperex can be so  
chaotic that they're really hard to prepare for 
but then watching gen I think it's more in the  
details and the way they play you can't you know 
you I don't think they're going to stray extremely  
far from how they play I just don't think it's 
in the DNA of the team so depends on the team  
for me and I think that's something pretty cool 
about Pacific that two different teams from that  
region came here and they're so polarizing in how 
they play thank you thanks this will be the last
question I am from the gamer agency and 
my question is what is the threat that  
has led your team to the final 
of the upper brackets against J
ji uh oh is that a me yeah this one's for you 
every sorry can you repeat it okay uh what is  
the straight that has led your team to the final 
of the upper brackets against J yeah can answer  
um for me the reason behind it I'll be honest 
uh for me is the country stuff because they  
Dr cap always do a perfect job honestly about 
preparing the game plane against every team in  
this tournament and they have like also good rids 
so it doesn't matter like even if the team doesn't  
didn't play this map before in this tournament 
they always like try to adapt between our game  
plan and I think yeah I think they make they made 
us play comfortable on stage almost every series  
so it's huge purose from them okay thank you he 
too nice there I could have done so much better  
today we all love you cap Andrew Andrew and I wish 
Drew was up here we miss Drew aome well that was  
the final question thank you very much we'll 
see you tomorrow thank you guys you thank you
