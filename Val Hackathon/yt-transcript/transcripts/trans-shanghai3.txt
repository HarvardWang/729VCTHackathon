here we go we will start with strafe Esports if 
you'd like to ask the first question thank you  
hi guys first of all it was a great game between 
you and PRX I'd like to say congratulations on the  
win so first question from me from me is that PRX 
picked you specifically for this matchup how does  
it feel to beat them in the way that you did this 
question is open for any of the players or the
coach honestly it feels great um the 
first match we kind of just chocked it  
as like you know we're not warmed up and 
you know and then we started picking it  
back up and then you know our Vibes were 
still great uh even after the first map  
and then going to the second map uh we knew 
we're starting to attack both games and our  
attack uh was insane against them we knew they 
struggled on defense and they're really good  
on attack so we just took that momentum 
and just again the Revenge the two-year  
Revenge feels great especially everyone you 
know clowning and doubting us on Twitter  
and um yeah just happy to be here all right 
thank you thank you we'll go next to nerditude
hi guys congratulations uh on this big 
win being one of the strongest teams in  
the tournament especially the favorite 
win The Masters it's huge my question  
is for anyone on the team who wants to respond 
what was the key to your strategy to take them
down I would say it kind of knew the pacing how 
they were going to play and so it came down to a  
lot of team play of how we're going to counter 
their pacing because we don't really face that  
often kind of a team that you you know what's 
coming your way but you got to be able to stop  
it it's like you know and that was a big Focus for 
us um in practice Josh was prepping us pretty hard  
to be able to deal with such an aggressive team 
like it's a different play style we have to play  
and I would say the first map like we had a 
game plan but we were messing up like small  
details that let them capitalize and they're 
a great team so they're going to be able to  
close out those rounds like easy if you give it 
to them going into the next two maps like Jonah  
was talking about earlier like starting attack it 
let our game plan like kind of flow a bit earlier  
because on defense being that aggressive in my 
opinion is pretty bad like it was easy to react  
against them and so yeah game plan felt really 
good going into it and we did stuck to Our Roots  
thank you so much and congratulations 
thank you thank you we'll go next to
Pedro hey guys uh likewise congrats on the 
victory I got a question for for icy I mean  
looking at at this series and how it transpire 
you know you definitely took it into another  
level especially on that third map and it's an 
improvement from what we've been seeing out of  
you so far in discernment um well question is 
just sort of how do you view your improvement  
so far as this tournament just part and also um 
what kind of went right for you in that third  
map and against against PRX uh throughout the 
entire series I feel like I was hting my shots  
and my igl Valen was in Flow State all series 
felt like at least last few maps and sorry but  
you know I just felt like when he's in Flow 
State it just allows for like all us other  
four players to you know just capitalize 
off that and just play our own games and  
I just felt like I was also in Flow State 
like kind of bouncing off of B on my other  
teammates just felt like we overall played great 
today especially in the last few maps and like  
for me just Fel like I was hitting my shots 
and I was also in Flow State he's been this
good thank you we'll go uh next to grill
news thank you congratulations on the big  
on your Victory and my question is for anyone 
who wants to to answer how do you feel right  
now after this great Victory what were those 
moments that the team experienced during the
game Josh can you repeat the question please
okay how do you feel right now 
after this great Victory what  
were those moments that the 
team experienced during the
game I thought um obviously we feel elated 
feel great about this win it's a very much  
a team Victory um we went through a roller 
coaster in a sense that we got dominated map  
one we felt like we had the right reads but 
we couldn't execute in the 33s 44s and like  
we missed the clear or um essentially capitalize 
off our mistakes um but the second half of that  
first map kind of proved to us like hey they're 
actually vulnerable we can beat this team we're  
getting some rounds back just to just to prove 
to ourselves like we can do this right so yeah  
we didn't have enough rounds to play around with 
and they were able to close out map one um but  
map two everything start to click in place like 
the team play the community ation um a strategy  
all of it was good um and again like what they 
said everyone was in Flow State there was there  
wasn't real emotions really we're were just going 
through what we practiced what we were how we're  
reading the game and it was just a close out at 
the end so yeah um it feels relieving that this  
kind of this kind of Victory worked out for us 
um during game one during game one paper x was  
up by a lot what was the conversation like like 
after that to achieve the mental reset um kind of  
like basically what I said was um like hey guys 
like it it really even the score was like very  
lopsided for them it was mainly on us that gave 
him that score and that's generally how this game  
works like you got to make a lot of mistakes 
for that score to happen and so once we kind  
of cleaned up our team play um support each other 
and make sure we're like all on the same page we  
were able to execute the game plan the div Vision 
that we wanted to play and that dominated um and  
they couldn't stop us so hence map two and three 
thank you we'll go uh back to Pedro for the next
question for many people uh g2's victory over PRX 
uh was a statement win and just won that you know  
disproved all of the daughters that surrounded 
this team and how this series will play out for  
you uh valon how would you kind of look at a 
g2's form after going through a series like
this to be honest I I'm I'm biased because I'm 
not jail but I've always known we were a capable  
team of doing this like it's not really shocking 
to me or it's not like a proving game or statement  
victory at least for myself maybe for the outside 
people it's like oh G2 is insane but we all my  
guys around me we know that we this is something 
that we can do on the regular um it does feel nice  
to I guess gain that respect from people that 
were good but I don't mind like if you want if  
we're The Underdogs if you want to pick us first 
whatever whatever we're trash like keep that and  
we'll we'll just keep doing our thing game by game 
I think what helps us throughout these matches  
is our coaching staff like prepping us a lot 
because you go through different play Styles um  
and different pacing versus like these different 
teams internationally and Shaq or Peter and Josh  
they prep us really well for these kind of 
teams and so when we throw in a mix of good  
preparation from them plus good players and just 
doing our own thing it's a nice mix to be able to  
compete against anyone right including paper 
x today so felt nice kind of like proving to
ourselves thank you we'll go next to uh 
strafe e Sports I again this question is  
for all of the players and the coach so 
your next match will be against either  
EDG or team heretic so would uh do you have any 
preference on either of the on either of these  
teams who you want to play and also do you 
have any expectations for the upcoming match
or I don't think we care who we play I think 
we'll be very confident no matter who wins  
this matchup and yeah that's pretty 
much it we're going to be confident
so U if you do play EDG uh you'll be playing 
against the home team on a home CR crowd so do  
you think there's a significant advantage that 
that they would have in a home crowd or do you  
think it doesn't matter at all I don't think the 
home crowd will give them any advantage I think  
it'll just I think it'll be pretty easy match 
for us I think it Buffs us too like when we  
feel energy in the crowd when we feel it gets 
us hyped and keep us dialed in it's so fun so  
I'm down to play udg people are going to get 
Rowdy it's the most fun games see a couple of  
you kind of watching the match what's going on 
right now any uh thoughts on what you're seeing  
what are you guys seeing I'm watching Heretics I 
can't even see anything destroy them it's about
be not too sure EDG I mean it's Heretics pick so 
it's whatever we got almost 13 no today we won  
the first round and we're like thank God we're 
didn't get 13 no so anything's anything's H  
anything's possible in this game nice uh we'll 
go back to nerditude for the next question
thank you so much my question is for iy iy 
is your first Master you are facing one of  
the strongest teams in the world I saw you a bit 
frustrated during the split and you ended up as  
the match MVP how do you feel about that um for 
me like going into this game like obviously we  
had a rough start but I think especially like the 
the last half of split kind of like you know like  
kept me confident you know going to this game I'm 
just like training as any other game so just went  
in confident and like I realized like they have a 
lot of flaws in their play style like the way we  
were playing our attack rounds so it just felt 
like I was able to go out there just be myself  
and you know do what I do in scrims thank you so 
much and we'll give the last question to Pedro
Romero this question goes to Josh uh it 
was mentioned a little bit during the press  
conference about how you prepared the this match 
against PRX I I understand that you don't want  
to reveal too much but still in terms that you can 
reveal or some of the the biggest aspects that you  
were looking at within this PRX team ahead of this 
match that kind of set the stage for you guys to  
come out with the w I think it's no secret that um 
one of the keys to Victory against or keys to like  
beat um papx is to control their aggression you 
know they're going to be aggressive team you got  
to be able to stop it and you got to understand 
what their pacing is like um so a lot of this  
week is just understanding like understanding 
identifying like and figuring out like what  
are good plans to beat that kind of team um we we 
weren't able to put that together in map one but  
you know map two and three um we executed well um 
so my question is all of your matches were a 2-1  
victory was there any uh reason in particular 
or something just why you are so formidable  
on uh decid a Maps we figure them out usually 
like figure them out we have deep map Pool so  
yeah there nothing really the other teams can do 
to scare us thank you guys oh my God he mic Dr D
