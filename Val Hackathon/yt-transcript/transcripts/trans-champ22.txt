good evening levaton we are joined 
recording in progress we coming off  
of a victory uh we will begin with Andre from prin
Esports hi good evening my question goes for eopa 
remember stage one we hadat and the Cen get up  
from M where they started losing and didn't give 
there 100% now everything is different you come  
back in Maps where you have a score of 48 you 
win over times without problems what have you  
changed compared to stage one to be the monster 
that you are now I think it's mostly confidence  
I think everyone just trust in the structure in 
in the team a lot more so even when we're down uh  
what we said in the halim of lotus is just trust 
each other guys you don't need to you don't need  
to overcompensate you just need to do your job and 
trust that everyone else is going to do their job  
and then we're going to win so I think this is 
like our mindset going into into every game and  
winning or losing doesn't matter as long as we 
keep this structure we we're always going to win
much thank you very much thank you uh we have a 
question from the room next hello I'm via from  
nerud my question is for ASAS uh before today's 
match mini boo said that he was going to Jet  
def you uh now that the game ended and you won do 
you have anything you want to comment back to him  
no I don't have like any comments but uh if 
someone like talks something like that I usually  
just focus on myself and I tend to like not care 
about it and I just focus on doing my best thank  
you aspas we have one more question for you 
coming from uh score um you're going to play  
EDG in the upper bracket final what do you think 
about that matchup uh I really excited to play  
against them again it's going to be my third 
time playing against them first time was in  
Tokyo second time was in champions last year uh 
now it's going to be the third time other the two  
games that I had against them was fun and this one 
I think it's going to be fun again so I excited uh  
just if you humor me for a second you guys have 
been staying together probably for the last two  
weeks in the same Hotel uh do you guys ever cross 
paths uh during your dayto day yeah I think I  
already saw everyone from every team I Almost sure 
EDG is on the same floor as us and they're like  
across the whole their par room yeah yeah any good 
stories from the last couple weeks or everyone is  
dying outside the bre rooms oh yeah oh I have 
one I have one one day um I left the bre room I  
don't know what was happening but I saw someone 
from fanatic he had a chair outside of the pr  
room and he was just sitting on the chair I don't 
know who was because I normally I need glasses to  
see from fire and I never use them so I just saw 
someone sitting on the chair outside of the prank
room oh man all right we'll take 
the next question from uh FD news
fundo I'm the mut right now all right thank you 
thank you lean for your time and congratulations  
for your win I will ask I will ask to a question 
to King I wanted to do it in Spanish Victoria
chions
am
yes thank you we'll take the next 
question from Antonio at nerditude
thank you so much hi I'm from 
narud and my question is for for
um
thank you so much and congratulations guys we'll 
take the next question from Fernando game arena  
thank you very much hi guys my name is Fernando 
from game arena Brazil my questions goes for
ASAS for
can I do another one go ahead uh so this 
one is for for iopa so so far Le vatan won  
against America EMA and Pacific but lost to 
China against trace and you guys playing EDG  
next uh what you going to do different so far 
to to beat China and get a spot on the grand
finals I think I think we need to see how EDG is 
playing exactly because in my opinion they're a  
very different team compared to trace uh I don't 
think they they have like similar play Styles so  
I can't really put them in the same category 
apart they're from China obviously um so we  
just need to see how they're playing adjust our 
play style and and when this is uh this is how we  
were doing it so far so I don't see any reason to 
to change it or do it in any different way thank  
you very much and good luck next game thank you 
uh Comm uh if you'll humor me for a second um you  
getting any texts from your former teammates 
uh being as the last man standing anything  
interesting popping off in the group chat uh I 
haven't gotten anything yeah I know booy would  
say I hate that you're winning right now um 
and then I think I'm sure I'm sure I'll get a  
little text from jaw because him and I are still 
close um but I know jaw is coming here at some  
point so I'll see him but that's nothing much 
yet hopefully hope we everything good nice all  
right uh we'll go to the next question from Andre 
from PR Esports hi my question goes to King like
well for
thank you uh and I believe this might be the last 
question of the conference we'll go to nerditude
thank you so much um hi I'm from n my question 
is for aspas aspas is there any manga or Manga  
you are going to be reading to prepare for for 
the next match sadly no because I I can't read  
on stage so sadly I no but I'm reading the 
pr room before I going to Stage so before  
going to Stage I always reading a manga today I 
started a new one it was like something I awoke  
as a battle God something like that uh it only 
has seven chapters and I read all seven here  
in the pr room so maybe for the next match I 
will be reading a new one in the pr room thank  
you so much thank you we got a couple more that 
came in uh Solera if you'd like to ask the next
question something fell over in the next 
room over someone fell died nobody died  
I I bet hello guys and congrats with the win 
uh my question is to eal since like champion  
is like a marathon uh and I was curious about how 
you pacing uh the energy level of the team and uh  
you will have like five days um how much of them 
will be the preparation how much of them will be  
the rest uh and are you're going to like prepare 
only to EDG or you're going to look into other  
competitors as well thank you I feel like if I 
said that we're going to prepare for five days  
I'm gonna get beat up after that what's what's 
your answer buddy what's your answer answer wise  
I'm very curious we are watching you yeah oh I 
can't handle the pressure guys I'm not a player  
I'm just a coach uh but I think we're managing our 
our energy by honestly I think we're working a lot  
less than other teams right now is just um for 
us it's really important to have like good energy  
and good uh good Focus which you know if you're 
screaming consistently and you're having like five  
six SCS a day here it's it's going to mess you up 
at some point um um and as for how we're going to  
prepare for EDG we're still going to discuss this 
because obviously we're um we're a team we still  
need to see like if if everyone is if everyone is 
okay if every if somebody feels a little bit more  
tired maybe we can have one or two days off maybe 
I'm pretty sure you're gonna say that you're tired  
so tired all of a sudden I got ex actually I'm 
fading right now guys we didn't even play a third  
map in three games like I don't know what you're 
talking about yeah feels like we didn't but we had  
three over time yeah yeah yeah so yeah we're we 
still need to decide how we're going to prepare  
exactly but I open to place a chair outside of 
the pr room yeah we might we might get the whole  
PR room to ourselves can we have a massage shair 
outside of the pr room yes okay thank you so much  
and good luck in the next round thank you thank 
you thanks we had a couple more come in um Andre  
you're up now uh this is my last question and 
it's for com how have you prepared yourself to  
be at the level you are now being to frag on some 
Maps saving rounds and going from being the most  
great guys set to now being the most love it and 
praise it um I think for me the way I prepared  
I mean I think this since stage two started I 
prepared like 10 times harder than I did probably  
previously honestly ly um but I I think genuinely 
I think it's just a difference in confidence in  
each other and and in myself so to be honest there 
wasn't any like huge preparation difference it was  
just like yeah I'm just confident in myself that's 
it thank you so much and all of you good luck on  
your next match thank you and uh Fernando you will 
have the last question thank you very much so this  
question go for Tex so Tex uh after America's 
finals I asked you on the press conference if  
you thought you were the best Sentinel in the 
world it's so far so good being a lot of good  
games top three on Champions could be maybe a 
title I want to ask you the same question do you  
think you're the best stino in the world right 
now and if you don't who you think is ahead of
you I'm going to be humble I would say um I 
still have a lot to prove um but I would say  
that I'm on the rise to become the best Sentinel 
but maybe once I win Champs I can confidently  
say it and who's better um I really couldn't 
give you a name to be honest but uh yeah just  
got to work hard and if I win Champs I'll say it 
thank you very much good luck don't worry about  
that see leaton thank you so much for taking 
the time to speak with us tonight thank you
