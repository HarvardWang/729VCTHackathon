we are joined by fanatic who are coming off of 
a victory against G2 we'll begin with questions  
from the remote media and then move to the 
in-house media uh let us begin with Allan  
uh so this is a question for Boler hi Boler alen 
hello hi uh congrats on the wing and uh so today  
you have a very different look from your last 
match and you start the game very fast uh and  
the team is really you know showing their five 
powers all over all the sers and uh it is comp  
uh completely different from your last match 
because you start slow on the last match so  
uh what do you think is the most difference thing 
between this match and last match on maybe on the  
preparation on the mindset or something like 
that I think it's it's solely on the mindset  
of our players going into the game you know um 
we re we spoke about yesterday's game and what  
we didn't like and what we could go improve on 
from to uh into today's game and yeah we just did  
that and that's like I said the only thing that 
we lose to is ourselves and now we Alfia gave a  
astounding speech before the game and uh he for 
some reason when he talks it rils up the players  
and we end up just popping off on all cylinders 
so I think it's just we know we know how to win  
it's just how much we want to win is going to be 
the question and I'm not talking about in the game  
I'm talking about before the game like when we're 
when we're getting into the mindset and today we  
showed how much we wanted to win and today I 
think we showed a really good um fanatic uh  
and then on bind you know g2's best map but like 
yeah we we somehow managed to scrape that one as  
well easy no I'm joking it was not easy it could 
have gone either way but yeah good good learning  
experience and we know how to win okay thank you 
and congrats again thank you thank you uh alier  
is there anything you can share about the speech 
that you gave before the match I mean I'm kind of  
wi man in the team and when I'm talking I know 
how to boost them that's why I mean I didn't do  
anything different I just talk and everyone 
played well said he's the white man in the
team thank you uh we have a question coming in 
from score Esports um this goes to booster uh  
can you predict who your next opponent will 
be um I'm hoping it's s honestly um mainly  
because I was saying it in a interview that uh 
if EDG beats sen then all the stress that they  
had in Shanghai um you know they're playing a 
bit more freely at this event which would be  
kind of cool um and also I want s because El's 
talks too much you know he's all over Twitter  
and I've seen him in the gym and he doesn't 
even lift that much man like he's so skinny  
like when he's when he's next to me on the bench 
press I'm one- handing what he's doing with two  
hands like it way bro you know like that's why 
I think I need to play zelis you know because  
when I'm gripping my mouse I might break 
it but luckily it's the fanatic mea so  
like there we go also hi Mom I think my mom 
might be watching she wanted a shout out so  
yeah there you go anything else that that was 
an impressive plug um we will now go to uh FD
news hey guys uh can you 
hear me yes well first of all  
ER congrats on the win happy birthday Chronicle 
thank you so much and my question is going to  
be for for Bower after after crew match you said 
that you want you want to you wanted to face Shu  
and well after you beat you beat C2 and now what 
are your thoughts on on how the the match evolved  
and how how was the match um I think I think they 
they were a bit looking like us yesterday maybe a  
bit nervous a bit uh scared to win and I think 
we we we already had our learning experience  
yesterday and we we we showed a different side 
of fanatic we showed the experience of like last  
year and winning two trophies and stuff and the 
players that had done that have really stepped up  
today and showed like how they can potentially win 
this trophy too so I think that was the difference  
with G2 I think they're a really good team um to 
be fair Valen shoots a lot better than I am but  
um but that's how the game goes sometimes you 
know like we we ended up winning um but yeah I  
think they they yeah good learning experience 
for them um and yeah that's that's that's all  
I have really if if I was on the team I'd just be 
like yeah we lost but it sucks and that does suck  
thank you we have a question in the room I'm elen 
from one sports I have a question for chronicle  
first of all happy birthday and I'd like to know 
we'd like to know how does it how does this wind  
feel right now like how are you feeling what are 
your thoughts um I broke my birthday curse because  
I was losing muches every time I had a happy 
birthday really close to games or just from the  
same day it was like for three years straight 
again and uh it feels good to actually win at  
least once so for now uh I broke the curse as I 
said and uh we can go to the next match against  
stinos or EDG doesn't matter who will be there 
but I think we will show good if we'll perform  
exactly like that like we performed today and yeah 
I feel quite confident thank you uh we'll take a  
question from sidar next uh hello guys congrats 
on the win today uh I also have a question for  
booster I'm sorry um and and yeah happy birthday 
by the chronicle thank you uh booster I would like  
to know more about the final round on bind and 
what was the thought process behind the set play  
on inch hours because it was such a peral moment 
of the match and he went for the play I mean the  
team went for the play it didn't work out but then 
Chronicles miracle happened and he has won the map  
but I would like to know the whole thought process 
be going for such a volatile play in such an  
important moment of the match um we were like yeah 
and scrims showers crunches ain't going to work  
um and so when it comes to official we're like 
maybe it'll work in an official uh they've been  
abusing showers from us so let's give it a go and 
yeah at the original timing I put my star down put  
a stun down because I was like I think I can do a 
stun and help them out and then we didn't crunch  
with it and I was like oh no The Jig Is up I've 
revealed what we wanted to do and then they went  
back in and then I was like I'll put another star 
down and I put a star down again and we crunched  
and I was trying to stun and I forgot it was on 
cool down so then I was like uh I was like oh  
damn uh quick I sucked them instead so I sucked 
them and then Alfie was like bro that suck got  
me killed and I was like oh my bad and then we're 
in a 4v2 and I was like chro where are they where  
are they he said they're in showers and I was like 
right he was like a it and I was like okay I all  
eat it uh for him and then they managed to Molly 
Molly and we're like okay I'm on my way wait for  
me grum wait for me I'm coming in and I'm like 
okay I'm going to suck them and get half I sucked  
them off and got half and then they couldn't 
swing out the showers wall and then I was like  
oh maybe one going to Crunch from the shore so 
I turned around and I saw Leaf's foot and then I  
just sprayed through the wall I saw something and 
then yeah they came out the showers and my life  
flashed before my eyes I felt like Doma back in 
2021 Iceland bu blind spraying with my left to the  
right and luckily cron kills all three I'm dead 
and then he diffuses his bike and I was like yeah  
we had it all along nice rank story bro that's 
the last round uh can I put one comment on that no  
sorry uh on that round I say to cron uh I'm going 
to call you to open your wall but I just realized  
I didn't say anything to CR I actually about it if 
I say open your wall crown that run it's going to  
be perfect because when I flash the outside of the 
behind the wall guys break my flash that's why I  
it's my my bad yeah don't worry mate we'll we'll 
we'll watch we'll cancel that we'll cancel that  
thank you so much for your Insight 
guys do you mind if I ask a followup  
question go ahead I'd like to ask 
this question to Der um could you  
let us know why you're not using the 
glitch pop bandle anymore at this
tournament serious question that's a serious 
question uh uh I can't remember one game that  
we won I think after thex or something I just 
swapped it on the last map yeah against crew I  
think I SW swed to that uh a on De like purple 
one with the Master's body and then I dropped  
her and I was like maybe I don't switch from 
this from now that's it okay thank you and  
good luck in the next game thank you right thank 
you we'll take the next question from Cecilia hi  
everyone Cecilia for. Esports my question is 
for hero first of all um congratulation on the  
win and happy birthday Chronicle uh last time 
that we met here was in Berlin after your win  
against vitality and you said that heading 
into Champions you wanted to learn from your  
teammates uh various things um what have what 
what are the lessons that you've learned so  
far from them during this tournament um I've 
learned a lot I would say like I've learned  
stuff about myself like weaknesses and just 
like stuff like tips in general just like what  
everyone's mindsets are and like what every one 
thinks about certain scenarios that's probably  
what I would say he's learned how to find 
light switches in hotel rooms um stuff like  
that it's been pretty pivotal for him shower 
yeah you like how to work the shower as well  
so he's learned a lot airon unit the whole 
thing he's worked at how his a hotel room
basically thank you thank you uh we'll go 
next to arnab guys uh my question is for  
booster uh correct me if I'm wrong but I have been 
noticing that you have been using sniper rifles  
a lot this tournament whether be operator 
or outlaw uh any specific reason behind it
um uh I think I don't know really sometimes I just 
feel like I want to use it and that's kind of it  
um back in the day I didn't used to do it because 
I was a bit nervous at like oh what if I miss my  
shot and yesterday against Heretics I literally 
if I had a rifle when bu dashed onto hero with the  
gecko I would have killed that guy I think with my 
rifle so it's it's it's it's hit and miss I think  
sometimes it will work out sometimes it won't 
but there was a there was a reason why I did it  
today on the bind um but I can't reveal it because 
it's it's two Giga brain you know it's two meta so  
I'm afraid you'll have to you'll have to think 
about it yourself um but no I don't know just  
it's fun and I like it when P says he's got the 
boa op out and he's Astro again he's walking  
showers but I didn't walk showers because I'm 
too scared to die so uh I ended up just sitting  
back and not really doing anything with it 
walking for two minutes straight bro that's  
actually impressive the best I ever seen one 
it it actually reminded me of when mini used  
to sco you uh in overtime you picked up and up 
in outside uh showers in B while playing asra  
yeah yeah that was the Copenhagen one yeah 
yep thank you times both of Fring back then  
thank you guys and all the best for the 
next match thank you thank you Minnie's  
over here in the corner laughing as well um 
we'll take the next question from Soul era
Solara if you'd like to unmute your mic oh you're 
here okay got it hello guys and congrats with the  
win I have not serious question to Alpa uh so 
yesterday I was talking to Tex and he was like  
alha is going to drop in Nuke I feel like it 
was a little bit delayed and the nuk dropped  
on G2 instead of Heretics today um so and 
we were also discussing like your new hair  
color and tex said that like your new hair color 
will be either a buff or a Nerf for you so I was  
curious how are you feeling on stage within new 
hair color is it a Nerf or buff uh right now I'm  
the like the girl who is losing his mental 
like her mental sorry when they change the
colors nice I'm excited to change I'm 
I change my hair color because I mean  
it make me excited more I don't know I don't 
have any feeling about it I'm just having fun  
okay great thank you thank you uh we'll take a 
question from sidar oh hi again uh I'd like to  
ask this question to coach Elma um talking about 
the heaven map uh and the iso piic it seems like  
you're one of the few teams that still uh opt for 
this ISO piic despite like other teams moving on  
from it uh could you explain more about the 
process of like thought process of picking  
it and do you think more teams can actually you 
know try it out and maybe work it out and like  
you guys I me it depends on what players you 
have I we have Derk and Alpha which let just  
play yoro and yoro and ISO together I don't think 
many teams have the players that would let you do  
that they have they kind of set up more for 
like double initiator kind of situation they  
not playing like silver breach but I mean for us 
it just works you got to you got to play play the  
strength of your players and what's going to what 
you're going to get the most out of them and I  
think our Havens I we've been playing really well 
on Heaven I think it's just because everyone's  
playing roles they really like and everyone's 
really comfortable and yeah it's just about just  
about playing the strength he plays all right 
thank you thank you we'll take a question from  
Cecilia C you're breaking my heart oh that might 
be a a lagging hand um this no go ahead sorry I  
I do have another question question possible um 
how is everyone in is if you all excited but how  
um how much are you guys excited to potentially 
reach finals and have the opening ceremony um  
out in front of you for me I'm I'm just looking 
forward to going to Heidi LA tonight um honestly  
but we'll take it day by day uh but yeah if we 
do get there that'll be sick I can do some K-pop  
dances what about you guys yeah I'll do a K-pop 
dance one by one yeah I mean all the tournaments  
we were warning about we are not playing that 
much game and we have the chance to play much  
more much more game right now and no one can 
whine about it I hope yeah I mean that's a good  
experience for us we didn't visit any finals 
properly except the regional one so it's time  
I think it's usually one player who whs about oh 
we haven't played matches in Tokyo don't look at
me well thank you so much thanks uh and arnab

thank you uh my question is for again boster 
uh when do you decide your uh match winning um

idea and then it's like yeah can we do it is  
it logistical and then we're like yeah let's 
do it we've we've we've somehow come up with  
the next one too um to like yeah for our next
