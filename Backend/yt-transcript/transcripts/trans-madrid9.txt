hello everyone welcome to the press conference 
we are joined by Sentinels who have won the match  
today and we'll be advancing to the Grand finals 
tomorrow if you have any questions for the team  
please use zoom hand rais feature we'll start with 
in-person media first hey guys Andrea from strafe  
here I felt like SOS was going to win so I came 
in Sentinel red today so quick question I want  
to make for Tyson so Tyson outstanding game from 
you and all the team as always congratulations  
on going to the Grand finals uh I want to bring 
a topic I made for the for both loud in paper  
x yesterday around community support and how 
their criticism can be a problem to a team and  
to a person because not a long a long time ago 
you had some issues with all the social media  
backslash right so now today of course everyone 
is going to be cheering for the team is going to  
say you are all the best in the world next time a 
Los comes you know that's not going to happen so  
I want to a little bit of your perspective around 
how social media how the fans how the supporters  
can be both uh help to a person but also uh a 
problem when loses happen I think overall uh  
it is a double-edged sword having a very uh very 
high like fan base a lot of people that support  
you because also like what you said um when it 
comes on to like losing the fans or so-called  
fans can kind of turn their back and be like oh 
you guys are not great like they can say a bunch  
of mean comments and stuff but uh yeah overall 
like it is amazing to have the the fans that we  
do and have the the the support of all of them 
but sometimes like it is best to like ignore uh  
social media when we l a match just because of 
how harsh the criticism can come awesome thank
you hey guys I'm from biger agency 
and my question is first of all is  
congratulation and make it it the final 
um I want to ask what was the deficit of  
the team in the third map and how 
do you feel about a rematch versus
ji um the deficit in the third map I think 
think we had some issues with our atmosphere  
with the way we communicate with the way we 
flow as a team yesterday and that's most of  
what we focused on going into today controlling 
our own game controlling our own atmosphere and  
you know we had it yesterday because the 
stakes were really high we had it today  
because we were up 20 and the stakes were 
really high uh winning or losing it's likely  
to happen when you get too excited and uh yeah 
I think the same it was it was a micro of what  
had happened yesterday and uh I think we did 
a good job proving that we can come back from  
it even in the middle of the series today and in 
terms of dealing with Gen we're just going to go  
in with that mindset make sure we understand 
we learned a lot yesterday and we applied it  
really well we can apply it even better tomorrow 
and focus on our own game and our own team thank
you hi I'm elain from one Esports and first of all 
congratulations on the big win and this question  
is for Kaplan so yesterday there seemed to 
be some frustration on your part regarding  
decisions related to map vetos and strategy so 
how do you feel about those aspects today and  
are you satisfied with the level that the team 
achieved today yeah I definitely was frustrated  
yesterday about some of my own decisions and 
second guessing them thinking is that a mistake  
I can learn from today there was not a lot of 
decisions to it it's much more simple in the  
situation of who we're playing and the way B5 
VTO works and it's the same thing for tomorrow  
right we don't even get a banned tomorrow so 
there's no mistakes to make so I'm G to be nice  
and uh relaxed kicked back knowing that okay 
I do have one more follow-up question and this  
is for everyone um how does it feel to not only 
overcome a formidable opponent like paper x but  
also assert dominance with having the better 
valorant bundle that's a zelus question this  
is a big question for zelus every match 
I win is for the Sentinels bundle so make  
sure you guys buy The Sentinel bundle thank 
you he's a simple man he's a simple man thank
you hello guys here T from Sons of KS first of 
all congratulations on your Victory my question  
is for Kaplan it's been uh two weeks with a lot 
of things going on um last week you even told us  
uh about jet lag about the dieting about a lot 
of changes that have been going on being another  
country um well this may have affected some of 
the performance of the team in some maps so I  
want I want you to tell us how do you handle these 
kind of situations to avoid being born out and to  
avoid being overwhelmed before every game and to 
accomplish this kind of um yeah victories yeah  
yeah uh there's so much that goes into it right 
you need to know when you need to take a break  
or an off day when you can even if you want 
to practice and clean stuff up in the middle  
of a tournament you have to control the team's 
expectations which I've not done a perfect job  
of and I haven't even control my own expectations 
in the best of ways at points in this tournament  
you need to be a really healthy human being to 
sustain the the stress the amount of energy and  
time you have to put in there's a lot we could 
do differently in my opinion to be a healthier  
team on simple physical level and as a unit long 
term and short term it's just about controlling  
what we can right making sure we're eating clean 
making sure we're resting uh we have a performance  
coach Doug Gardner who's been an incredible help 
with that and he's really helped us in the short  
term and I think he'll help us in the long term 
too and I think we're all really bought into  
understanding that we could be in better shape 
than we are and we could look a lot better at a  
different tournament in the future because of 
that and my second question is for second um  
you're performing you're playing again tomorrow 
against jeni but it's a different situation not  
only because it's a grand finals but also because 
it's a best of five instead of a best of three uh  
how do you feel uh in this case facing again 
with the Korean Champions and what do you what  
are your expectations in this uh specific scenario 
uh I'm really excited to be able to rematch them  
tomorrow I expect them to shoot back like they 
always do they're a very strong team obviously  
but uh I think we're going to bring the best 
version of ourselves that we can tomorrow and  
try and play good match thank you and good luck 
tomorrow thank you thank you hello H the first  
question is for Kaplan the different players 
speak a lot of time about the job of the of the  
quing St know with the preparation of the maps 
and the question is for you what do you think  
is the um main point that you improve respect the 
past Seasons ER in the coaching staff to to have  
better better performance I think a lot of it 
comes from being willing to delegate and let go  
of control and Trust the team as well as expect 
the team to step up and and fill in the empty  
gaps right so incredibly lucky to have John as my 
igl and he's such a bright person around the game  
and Drew has really stepped up as well and I think 
the whole team is really creative and understands  
the game in unique ways and we all come together 
and for me that's been something I've learned a  
lot even this tournament you have to uh spread out 
responsibilities otherwise it's just not realistic  
and and the quality of work goes down a lot so uh 
got to take a leap of faith and you know everyone  
has to trust everyone to to come up with stuff 
um the dark question in for1 because you are  
the only player in this tournament who have g a 
master in the past and tomorrow you can fight for  
the second master and the question is um how are 
your feels about uh this situation and um if you  
have what are your feeling about the support of 
a lot of people around the world no and this this  
ACH that is the only player that could achieve 
this in this moment I think overall there is a  
little bit of pressure yes um we're going into 
the grand finals of this tournament we're going  
to try our best uh but I think the most important 
thing other than winning is that we just show the  
best version of ourselves we play we have fun 
and as long as we learn something from it from  
it at the end of the day I think is what really 
matters to us uh sure a dub and another trophy  
would be really nice and bringing that to my team 
and the Sentinels fans would be amazing thank you  
and good luck tomorrow thank you thank you thanks 
hi Jack from GG Recon congratulations on the win  
today um there's a visible difference in how you 
came in today uh as to compared to yesterday you  
look pretty tired yesterday um but you guys have 
obviously played a lot of valorin over the last  
week or two um how much will fatigue come into 
tomorrow um obviously J get a day off and are  
you still riding on the adrenaline or are you 
really strugg is there a little bit of struggle  
with the obviously fatigue and that's directed 
so anymore Jer you want um I'll be honest we  
just played that much of Bor to get here so this 
was hour ago right we came to the Masters we got  
to Grand finals now we really want to win Masters 
because we have the chance so we got to take it  
so we don't care for like bur out or whatever 
we just want to play no fantastic thank you
all right we'll move to remote media 
questions first question from Brandon Esports
GG thank you very much congratulations on the win 
guys um I'll ask this to both tenens and Sassy if  
I could please um as mentioned before you know 10 
you've won a previous Masters sassy world champion  
you know in your rear viiew as well I just like 
to ask you guys if you have any comparisons of  
of those previous teams and kind of how this team 
operates in a similar fashion that's made you so
successful you want to go first yeah sure so I 
think this is my third final yeah third final to  
National Tournament speaking um there are a lot 
of like similarities but here is unique I think  
here we work like different you know I think 
like everyone's getting like involved doing  
like the hard work the coaches uh John with 
igl Jordan being like the guy that keeps us  
together no Zack and Tyson keep shooting please 
so I don't know for me it's just just another  
final I think the similarity between like passal 
and this one it feels like we're like a group of  
friends and that personally makes me feel a lot 
better and makes me play better individually and  
I think I think our uh our team work works a lot 
better because of that I'm just happy to be here
yeah thank you next question from Fernando uh 
hi guys congratulations on the wins and making  
to Grand finals I'm Fernando from valone 
from Brazil uh my question is for Sassi
sass
for
so thank you guys good luck 
tomorrow thank you thank you  
next question from Rael my sports hey guys 
uh congratulations on the win my question
go
for
thank you next question from Razer hi 
I have two questions from the valerant  
competitive Community the first is for 
John QT um after losing pistols on attack  
s have often opted to force spy without 
much success throughout this tournament  
and kickoff for a team that plays such 
transactional and disciplin valerant is  
there a reason why you put so much faith in 
the force into Force spies Force spy we win
every uh do we actually that's not a good look 
I me I think I think we won a few on but I don't  
know I feel like if you actually go back into 
those uh like uh Force buys we just lose it to  
some details I think because uh I know sometimes 
we just start maps like very slow and then it's  
like it's like a trickle down effect like the 
pistol I can already tell the team is a bit off  
in pistol cuz the communication is bad then that 
we force and we're like we're in a good position  
then we uh then we lose so yeah I think uh that's 
just how we are and uh we trust uh my teammates  
trust me and I think we have high chances of 
winning those Force rounds when we have a good  
plan and uh yeah I mean you can't win them all 
you won against l don't wor we how many of our  
hor losses are probably like something like an 
even numbers post PL I I get a Bucky entry every  
time and then you guys just throw I don't know 
figure it out it is in the details it's fine we  
lose it's on me we win on Z thank you Z thank 
you um and my next question is for the whole  
team um congratulations on the win it seems like 
your last match against gen the team overall had  
less conf confidence and was struggling to play 
like they had in games in the past today was uh  
that was completely swept under the rug what did 
the team do in order to find their confidence and  
play like a united front and do you think 
this momentum will carry into Grand finals
tomorrow one of you answer that what did we do 
um we had more fun than yesterday that's what we  
did um I mean we did we talked a lot we fought 
a lot too it's normal but I think like the big  
deal that is that we focus on ourselves a lot for 
this match that was I think the big difference and  
also Jordan Jordan like kind of like he got he 
got in the hotel so mad and they were like okay  
I never want to see Jordan s like that again and 
then I don't know we just play like a real team  
today you know I I can say any reason here but 
we just connected after the loss and I think the  
loss was was necessary for us to grow that's it 
yeah yesterday was an off day for us in general  
uh it was very incar Inc characteristic since 
the kickoff we were like super off communication  
was bad maybe a little bit of nerves because 
of the stakes were so high so yeah we talk  
we just make sure to focus on us and just be 
the Sentinels that we have shown before thank
you thank you next question from Ganesh 
at stri hi congratulations guys this is  
for Captain uh you said that you 
don't have to choose VTO but how  
much do you think the V Advantage geni 
has would play a factor in tomorrow's
game hopefully not much it's definitely be 
harder than if we had the advantage right  
they're a great team and we're probably going 
to miss out on playing some of our best maps  
and we're gonna have to play their best maps 
not going to be easy at all because of that  
but we you know had a hard time yesterday 
for a lot of reasons including not focusing  
on ourselves enough we focus on ourselves 
today that's the big thing for tomorrow  
we focus on ourselves and hopefully we can 
take down jeni even if it's a harder road  
than we would have preferred yep all the 
best for tomorrow thanks thank you thank
you so next question goes to zelis so zel you are 
like the public relationship part of the team you  
are The Wolf of Wall Street 2024 version you do 
it all but people sometimes fail to recognize  
the impact that you have on the server right you 
are not on the team because you want Sentinels to  
sell more bundles you are there because you're a 
very good player I want you to give your insights  
into how this challenging relation between doing 
it all on social media on public relations versus  
what you do on the server is for you and is 
for the team overall um yeah obviously I'm a  
big troll um especially in the Public's eye 
uh I think the biggest thing for me is like  
as long as my teammates know what I bring and 
like you know we're winning I'm doing my job  
like that's all that matters to me um as troll 
as I am and how many bundles I sell uh at the  
end of the day like I want to win my teammates 
know I want to win I know my teammates want to  
win so as long as we're team we're having fun 
we're going out there we're winning that's good  
enough for me awesome thank you thank you next 
question from Sports K Esports uh my question is  
for Kaplan so it's been almost a month since VCT 
start and even Madrid has been going on for over  
a week now what has been the most challenging 
thing as a coach in this event given that you  
were already among the tournament favorites and 
had to play so many matches to get here yeah uh  
the biggest challenge is playing really good 
International teams that play very differently  
than America's fighting burnout as a team and 
as a coach this is probably the first tournament  
that on a personal level I've ever felt like 
at points is there anything left in the tank  
before it's over and uh it's an awful feeling and 
it's one I would like to avoid ever having again  
I think on on my end I could focus on health to 
mitigate that in the future and delegating more  
but at the same time I'm really lucky to have 
a team that I can lean on you know that's part  
of it for me I I can say hey I need to lean on 
you guys or you guys need to step up today and  
they they can do it uh including Drew spark as 
an assistant coach and that's been a big part  
of it and yeah I think that's a a big probably the 
biggest challenge personally and I think as a team  
as well the other biggest one would be maintaining 
the ability to focus on ourselves in the face of  
extra public pressure extra expectations extra 
Stakes right obviously this is a more exciting  
situation to be in Grand finals in Masters Madrid 
then uh random group stage game and kickoff but  
at the end of the day the formula to to doing our 
best which is the best way to win is focusing on  
ourselves so just have to figure out new ways to 
stay focused on that despite the context of the
games thank you so much and good look for your 
games tomorrow thanks next question from ichiman  
hi guys congratulations my question goes to TS 
so there is a Sil saying that we have in Latin  
America and he goes like if they win it's because 
they had a really good breakfast so we would like  
to know what you guys had for breakfast and 
also uh what's what's you're gonna get for
dinner you guys eat breakfast I didn't eat 
breakfast we go down the line I I didn't eat  
you didn't eat anything no today at all a banana 
that's fire that's healthy that's concern I'm  
running on first time I heard that it's so I had 
two bites of a Subway Italian BMT sandwich and a
banana don't even ask me okay I had some chicken 
Caesar salad and some fruit smoothie thing what  
they have chicken burrito strawberries 
grapes rice and beans rice and beans rice  
and beans that said I had a pork klaw wrap with 
french fries and fruit and fruit and breakfast
damage two people who only had a banana popped off 
today that's all I'm saying it's not what I want  
to hear something wrong okay and do you expect 
oil to have for dinner for the way of today for
dinner I don't know room service the service 
for the time I was going to get taco though  
that's what that's like ad or I just want to talk 
about okay uh I don't know we'll figure that out  
in the shuttle I think looks like we're going have 
another argument okay thank you so much I will say  
good luck by I'm sure you guys don't need it yes 
we do appreciate it we do we do do okay good luck
then thank you next question from K Spike tap 
hey how's it going guys um I just have a couple  
questions for tens two quick ones um actually 
it was back to the food subject I just wanted  
to ask uh there's a really famous clip of you 
not eating obviously you're kind of still doing  
that I just want to ask you um yeah like how 
much also this could go towards whoever really  
like C whatever but like I just wanted to ask 
you like it's been a thousand days since um 128  
1028 days since you won reic stage 2 that's the 
last time you qualified for international Grand  
tournament um a lot of you have been on the stage 
for a long time obviously sasia has won multiple  
events been multiple finals um what do you think 
has contributed the most to your longevity on the  
scene and just like being able to compete at 
this level and continue to make finals for so  
long um since it's obviously not um eating give me 
a second uh I think it's just the the willingness  
to like adapt to the game I think valerant changes 
a lot as the game grows so valerant for instance  
in 2021 was a lot different uh running a bunch 
of duelist stuff like that um now I'm more on  
like a smok's roll sometimes flexing to other 
stuff so I think it's just kind of when new  
agents new maps get released um new players come 
and old players go but I think it's the ability  
to adapt to what is more like meta and be able 
to play at a high level for that awesome thank  
you good luck to tomorrow guys thanks thank 
you all right final question from Raquel my
sports hello helloo uh my question goes to 
John cin um people was asking me if you was  
uh do Ramadan and I I want to know uh 
how do you feel fasting in the entire
tournament uh I mean the first few the first 
few did were hard obviously uh the hardest  
part is uh not being at home and doing it at 
the same time because uh yeah uh hard to get  
food on time and then like I can only break 
my fast with the banana and like mid game  
and stuff like that so yeah it's it's a bit 
difficult uh I got used to it uh yeah today  
I didn't fast because uh I got sick and uh I 
know I woke up puke twice and I had to break  
my fast this morning so yeah I haven't I still 
haven't eaten much I just had water and some  
fruits but yeah I mean uh I think it's hard at 
first but after that it's kind of a buff I just  
feel very focused and like in in Flow State 
uh I know I just like I just can dumb down  
my emotions and uh just focus in the game thank 
you good luck thank you than you all right that  
was the final question congratulations 
today we'll see you guys tomorrow thank
you
