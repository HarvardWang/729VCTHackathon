here uh Team tics thank you for being here 
guys and congratulations for your Victory  
now we are going to open the question at 
the floor for question from the media so  
please raise your hand and I will call 
on you we're going to start with a
snap uh yes hello first of all congratulations on 
the win guys my question is for miniu so this was  
your first time facing off against jeni and in the 
teaser it was mentioned that you really wanted to  
play against them as they were the current best 
so how was the experience overall and did jeni  
live up to your expectations uh this was probably 
the hardest game I've ever played in my career uh  
it was like really hard after the game my head 
was hurting you know uh they play they played  
really good and uh I think we played also really 
good uh but this time we were better and yeah  
yeah they LED my expectations it was like really 
fun game to play and I hope it was a fun game to  
watch so yeah it was cool thank you so much yeah 
okay uh next question come from EST thank you so  
first of all I'd like to say guys great job on the 
win and also for you know making it to to playoffs  
so this question is for anyone on the desk to 
answer so seeing as how last time ji denied you  
guys from a trophy how what does it mean for the 
team to beat them this time in Champions I can  
answer uh I mean we don't have any like hatreds 
towards Genji you know I I think it's a lot more  
like love uh as you guys probably know um so I 
mean it feels really good honestly to you know  
I guess get revenge over them from Grand finals I 
still think they're going to make playoffs I still  
think they're going to do really good just because 
they're a great team um but yeah we don't I mean  
I mean for me it doesn't really mean anything cuz 
we beat jji it's more just like the the fact that  
we you know I think we've improved a lot um from 
you know Shanghai and even from like the start  
of tourament versus fpx we've just improved 
a lot since then so yeah I think we're really  
happy U I have a small follow-up question U do 
you think that geni was playing at their full  
strength or do you think that something looked 
off about the team in any way I think normal  
I can answer I think they did everything they 
could like they played 100% and maybe it wasn't  
it wasn't like the world championship you know 
performance but with we gave it all they gave  
it all I think it was super hard to play um like 
some rounds the way they played were like insane  
we didn't even have the chance to win them um so 
I think they played you know in full power um so  
did we as well all right thank you thank you 
for your question uh next question come from
Sierra yes hello uh first off congratulations on 
your Victory uh my name is Sierra just freelance  
um my question goes to either Neil Zeno or bu um 
so the last time you faced geni on Lotus it was  
that 134 lost at Master Shanghai during Grand 
finals that acted as their turning point for  
winning the series but this time it was a huge 
comeback for you guys and what turned the series  
around so other than the roll swaps from miniu 
coming back in over potty Tech what were some of  
the big changes you guys made after looking back 
at that VOD from Shanghai that led to your Victory  
um I think it's mostly just in general what 
we've done I think I think like Benji said we've  
improved quite a lot in the couple of days we've 
been here and I think uh it's not just the Lotus  
map but it goes down to just good preparation and 
good support for the team I think from you know  
Weber from our performance coach Rob for Nicholas 
like without them it wouldn't be possible so I  
think it's just in general we've improved a lot um 
but on lus more I don't want to go into specifics  
but I just think we did our homework we prepared 
really well and yeah like even though we're down  
uh the guys are becoming really really good at 
you know it's not over till it's over kind of  
mentality and I think we just powered through 
I don't think we were the same team back in  
in Shanghai so yeah we've improved a lot we've 
had ups and downs but yeah most important thing  
is now we're coming back up so I'm just proud of 
them thank you thank you uh next question is from
fundo okay guys I'm fak Dominguez FD news um 
my question is for anyone wants to answer uh  
during the second map it was a breaking point 
when you were 911 and you you make the the full  
comeback and you you won the map during the the 
deci it was the same situation but the opposite  
way and do do you feel like a bit of pressure 
of of the situation that maybe it was like a
50/50 from a coach's point of view no um and I 
think the players are probably similar I don't  
think honestly you don't have time to think 
about that like when you're playing and from  
coach's point of view we were only thinking about 
the round that we're in we're not really thinking  
about oh okay you know it's getting really close 
now and we also had a couple attack poses left I  
think we had two at one point so for me it 
was pretty chill and I think the boys were  
also really really chill the whole way through 
so I honestly think it's something that six seven  
months ago maybe we would have F the pressure 
a little bit but yeah I've said it before but  
I think the guys are getting very good at just 
focusing on the present and living in the moment  
and not thinking you know oh it's going to get 
close now we just focus on their own and that's
it thank you for your answer uh next question 
is from Antonio summer thank you so much hi  
from N2 first of all congratulations for the 
winning um today match was a range for the  
master shangai uh my question is for Rings Rings 
how different was it to play against ging today  
compared to the G from the Masters I think 
there is no like there is not much difference  
they are still good team and I think we are still 
a good team in master Shanghai finals uh they had  
like good advantages of like Banning two maps 
you know and then and that was kind of hard for  
us but today they had no advantage of like buning 
Maps you know it was like equal and we showed I  
think like um good in-game character you know we 
didn't G gave up especially on the second map and  
we managed to win but like if I compare the games 
in final and now like there is no much difference  
they are still good that's all I can say thank you 
so much thank so much uh oh sorry no no nothing oh  
okay thank you so much uh last two questions 
uh esorts thank you so this question is for
U sorry hello am I audible so sorry 
about that this question is for  
mini so you know this being your first 
International land with the team and  
also that you guys made playoffs are 
there any teams that you want to face  
in the playoffs or any teams that you 
expect you would be up against in the
playoffs uh it it's like first of all it's 
my second L because I play in M as well but  
we lost two games and second of all like uh 
I said I think I want to play against leevon  
uh you know and I against say it's like I 
don't know it's I I I think it's going to  
be a fun match to play also I want to play 
against G2 to Club them you know uh myself  
last time in shangai G2 I mean my team 
did it so this time I'm going to do it
myself all right thank you thank you uh we have 
uh next question is from AR here fromg question  
is for Coach new uh I want to know about the 
uhpc uh when you guys go for a map uh which  
uh essentially you have no info about the team 
such as ABS in this case uh for Gen uh no whats  
to look out for how do you guys prepare for uh 
that particular uh map and uh how do you think  
uh their map was uh against you and how do you 
think uh how do you think your team countered  
their play style throughout the series did you 
ask for the sorry the first question was it for  
Abyss did you say yes I yeah um so yeah like 
when you don't have any footage of the team  
is kind of difficult but we did some good prep 
uh I'll say that I'm not going to go into too  
much details so we kind of knew that that was 
going to be either a comp uh or we had a good  
idea that it would be their comp um just by kind 
of like logical what they're going to play what  
roles are going to use so it wasn't too much of 
a surprise when we seen their comp um and we kind  
of just focused on ourselves obviously it's nice 
for them knowing that you're going in without any  
anti strats so I think they just played their 
own game they played quite freely we learned a  
lot from that game I think so obviously I think 
we lost both pistols and we still it still came  
pretty close so I'm happy with how we played 
honestly because I think we'll learn a lot  
from that one and then in terms of like their play 
style they haven't they're not really a team that  
likes to change comps that much and like buo 
said there's and in as well there's not much  
change from them in terms of their play style so I 
think we we just got used to it and like the guys  
have also said even though you know how they're 
going to play it's really not that easy they're  
still a really really good team and the job is 
extremely difficult even though you know what  
they're going to do so yeah it was just about 
kind of digging deep and closing their hands  
out thank you guys and all the best in playoffs 
thanks so we have time for two more questions uh
sart hello guys congrats on the win today I'd 
like to ask this question to wo uh obviously  
you're rocking a new hair color so I like to know 
whose idea was this behind dying your hair I just  
give a promise to peoples if we go Champions 
if we qualify Champions uh I will do it so I  
did that's that's all like there is another say 
when you did it oh I did uh before three days  
no when did you make the pro promise oh nine 
months ago yeah nine months ago I said if we  
qualify Champions I will do it so yeah here we go 
me and my yellow hairs he's he's looking handsome  
no yeah I think it looks pretty good to very 
handsome yeah it looks really good I'm going  
to fix it after champions for mean bro you don't 
have to fix it embrace it chill bro shout up guys  
awesome uh good luck in playoffs uh thank you 
so much thank you uh now we have one question  
here in the room hello guys congratulations with 
your win first of all you look amazing so thank  
you second um my question is to Buu uh I wanted 
to say this B pixel kills today were just insane  
first of all uh and second um ging earlier today 
mentioned that on bind uh you changed your comp  
probably because you knew that uh with your 
previous comp you wouldn't be able to win so  
I wanted to know what was like the thought 
process behind uh like making the new comp  
and maybe you can make uh certain uh comments 
about like how J you think adapted to your new  
comp and my second question would be to the coach 
um you mentioned in the interview short interview  
between the maps that this is not your final 
form first of all I'm terrified and excited  
to see you in your final form of Champions uh 
and second I would like to know which things  
you you think can be improved by the end of the 
tournament thank you so yeah for the bind comp  
obviously we had like a lot of officials played 
with the vs on the previous comp like the 100  
thiefs comp um so we know that they're they're 
a good team they have good coaching stuff they  
an and we thought like we either change how we 
play the comp or we do other comp and we just  
kind of decided to go for another comp um and 
yeah we prepared it not for too long time wise  
uh I would say average it can be way way better 
um but yeah and how they counted that I think I  
think they didn't counter it very well I think 
on our attack um I mean we had some very lucky  
rounds that we won lucky clutches yeah but I think 
in general like the way we executed with the comp  
and like even though they we hit sides with four 
people like I don't know maybe two three times  
we still won them because of our good utility and 
trading so um they tried to counter it I think we  
did well they probably also did okay and when we 
were defense I think we misplayed Mis called a few  
times on what to do and those are like the rounds 
that we lost on the rounds that we honestly didn't  
do much and played more reactive to what they do I 
think those rounds were really good so yeah that's
forb uh yeah so um for me I think like yeah after 
the first map I did say that you know we weren't  
near our kind of final form yet and I do think 
it's partly because like it's something we all  
accepted we came we're coming into this tournament 
off of a slump and it's something that I've told  
these guys a thousand times and they're probably 
bored of hearing it but like every single team  
in sport every single player in sport you're 
going to have your highs and you're going to  
have your lows and then if you PR through the 
hard times and you you know get back to the top  
you're going to be reach even higher Heights and 
I think just it's not even it's not like we're  
there yet I think there's still a bit more to do 
but it is just part of the process I think like  
we had a couple of you know rough weeks in stage 
two um but like the guys have had a good rest the  
going to grow more in this tournament now I 
think like we're just going to keep improving  
like we did in Shanghai so it's mostly just 
the fundamentals for me that can get better  
um but the thing is we have more time though 
so we can you know drill it a little bit but  
it's also confidence just getting back to full 
confidence levels and I think this winter day  
is going to help a lot of them um because they're 
all incredible players you know and some sometimes  
you it's easy to forget that um after you've 
had a couple like rough weeks you know so so  
yeah it's just for me it's confidence and making 
sure our coms and stuff are good but it's already  
improved and it already improved after the first 
map so I'm just excited to see what happens thank  
you so much for your uh answer uh okay guys uh 
thank you uh to te tics for being here sharing  
your thoughts and experience congratulations 
once again for your bck thank you thank you
