if you have any questions for the team please 
use the zoom handr feature we will start with  
in-person media first and then move to remote 
media hello guys I'm Martin from Seward uh first  
of all congratulations on the victory thank 
you I have two questions for Alex yep so the  
first one you guys seem to be a confidence based 
team on your Duss and teamwork against EDG and  
GG that seem to not be there but today you guys 
seem really on point so how do you manage that  
and come from such a heavy loss against them 
and play your game and plan your uh game and  
moral up for this game uh the second question 
is the progression always shows you your and  
your reactions you are a very emotive person 
and Coach uh you smiled after the Mind Freak  
clutch and how do you manage your emotions when 
your players are taking let's say some risks and  
have you been nice to your table quite nice um 
for the first question I think um we honestly  
don't know what's going on um it's been up and 
down you know confidence every it changes even  
during the game itself uh you know after every 
loss we seem to have been able to bounce back  
and I think it has to do with us like sitting 
down and talking and making sure that our game  
plan is really tight for the game and then just 
trusting ourselves you know and then you know  
sometimes it gets really hard you know you get 
Thrifty and then they just the guys go on a five  
round run and usually it's very rare for us you 
know this doesn't really happen to us very much  
so we've just been trying our best to keep each 
other happy you know like just making sure that  
we're taking care of each other's emotions being 
good teammates basically um as for me how do I  
manage my emotions I mean uh I I've said this 
before but I I let it out I just let it out so  
that when I Tech po I don't actually say anything 
bad you know because sometimes it's just really  
like some ridiculous play you know uh we usually 
have a lot of rules and structure around how we  
want to go aggressive and if we you know sometimes 
we don't follow other rules and they made me lose  
my mind um uh the question yeah today today I 
smiled because I mean one4 you know like after  
after that happened there was a good chance 
that we head up on the ropes thank you very
much hey guys Andrea from strafe here first of 
all congratulations on winning the match and  
on going forward in the competition my question 
goes to anyone who wants to answer it but first  
uh I want to take a closer analysis to how the 
level of valent has increased from last season  
to this season you have loud and those insane 
comps that they make you have Team Heretics  
and you have Carmine Corp pulling up sets 
against fanatic and na'vi and now you have  
the Pacific teams showing the whole world 
their Firepower their uh quality and depth  
from the the strategies and now I want you to 
take to tell us for everyone how does valerant  
looks like now and if there is any more room to 
progress to evolve and how the the rest of the  
competition will look to the Pacific teams and 
try to beat them in the future thank you that  
was a big question sorry no it's okay um in my 
opinion you know um I do think they we're not  
playing very the level V is not the best this 
tournament I think like even for I think every  
all the eight teams would say it themselves 
you know it's been a St of the year you know  
and usually you need some time to for The Meta 
to settle for us to figure out what's going on  
so all of us are trying stuff you know you don't 
see like last year you didn't see W double du is  
on Breeze we didn't even see Breeze last year um 
you know there's new maps onet there's going to  
be new maps all the time um basically by the end 
of the year I expect that 2024 Champs is going to  
be the level will way higher than 23 CHS you know 
I think uh everyone is growing you know there's a  
lot of new rosters you know like even if like the 
format doesn't allow you to like make mistakes so  
if for example you're a fanatic and you bomb out 
you know and and and this gives you one month of  
actual training time you know they're going to 
come back like super good you know you can't  
count them up forever just they just throwing 
their name out there but not not actually saying  
anything about them um uh is that is that does 
that answer your question pretty much thank you
hello congratulation for the for the win ER 
the first question is for something ER you  
are playing a lot operator with GCO in in this 
tournament um with a good performance now the  
question is the what in your opinion what is the 
main difference between play the operator with  
jet or or Chet and with other agents and how can 
you manag the use of utility and and your role as  
initiator with the operator um it's really hard 
question what's the difference between I play  
with op on jet for example and with op on Geo I 
think it's all about confidence and all about how  
how I playing with on jet and on Geo for example 
on jet I think I can do a lot of mistake when I  
play with op and uh I need to do something with 
this I guess but on Geo for example I get kill  
I go back and I help my teammate by by spells 
because I'm g i not J I have flashh I have St  
I have moly I have alt and I guess that's it yeah 
okay the last one is for Alex sorry I always ask  
it's about sentin no because you play versus at 
American Champions and ER maybe sener is a team  
similar to geni in the question of they are very 
orate no have this retake this standard are more  
a lot of struct toate no and the question is can 
you um how will you prepare the match versus them  
at what your opinion about senting his play style 
I mean we have no time to prepare so I mean I for  
me me personally what I'm going to do is I'm going 
to relax tonight a little bit I wake up as usual  
what I do is I wake up very early in the morning 
and I try to watch everything I come up the game  
plan and the boys will come later and we discuss 
and I will have already sectioned like key things  
for them to watch and then they will discuss 
it you know and then we come up a game plan  
together um yeah that oh okay about Sentinel SP 
no about C playy in general what is your opinion  
I think they're very good I think they're very 
very good I mean they already be in Africa TV  
and you could tell that developing you know um 
I think um I think having zelis in the team is  
a big deal you know I think he manages to keep 
their emotions high and confident I think um p  
is playing Amazing on smokes you know I think it's 
been Revelation for him so they're coming together  
very nicely you know like I said before I think 
it feels like um it feels like when they first  
won rovic you know like it feels like they're 
coming back into their confidence you know T  
is having great performances you know it's just 
the same as last time you know so we're looking  
forward to the game um and we expect a very 
difficult one all right thank you thank you thank
you um hello guys uh firstly congratulations 
on your win today it was an epic game my first  
question is to Monette um uh sorry it's to mine 
freak actually um my bad but so on that second  
map you know you were you had like that insane 
one V4 clutch so can you take us through what  
was like going through your mind while all of it 
was happening uh actually when I got the first two  
kills when they push through the their own smokes 
I have a feeling that I could want it because the  
plan was in the open and I have like spot to like 
dancing around and yeah I'm just playing around it  
so yeah okay thank you and uh my second question 
is to Alex so like like my previous colleague  
asked you you are going up against tomorrow and 
the one of the arguably bigger problems is that  
because they're coming in as that upper seat 
they're going to have like a bit more control  
over the map veto so um how are you feeling about 
that and what do you think they will allow to  
allow the sunset to slip through again like today 
I don't know we have one good map and I think the  
whole world knows this now so we'll see I mean I 
I think I think I think run I don't think we're  
B sunet but you never know you know like who who 
knows like maybe maybe they maps that they feel  
that shaky on as well you know so uh I don't know 
how the format Works maybe it's one band each and  
in their case maybe maybe I mean we sh we share 
a lot of maps that we like to play together you  
know so there's a there's a good chance that like 
we're all going to get five maps that we like to  
play you know we got lot of how um shaky our map 
PO is right now hey can I G to ask a followup to  
that uh how do you feel about facing Sentinels on 
split anyone can answer it doesn't have to be Alex
for we win this yeah we won one time wji fin 
no no no no this tournament this tournament we
won I I I don't know man I we we just playing we 
got we got to play and figure it out like there's  
no time to do do anything drastic okay good luck 
good luck for tomorrow guys and thank you very
much hi guys this is L for mgg my question goes 
to something what is your initiative to was is  
this your initiative to flex on Gecko and not 
any other initiator and is it because you can  
play a bit more for yourself and with an 
agent that's a bit more Dynamic I would  
say I think yeah because the gecko I feel like 
it's only the agent when you can play selfish by  
yourself because any other agents for example 
Sky fight breach it's all about go with the  
team and take some info but when you play on 
gecko you can be like selfish like as I do for  
example when I Playa and uh why we choose gecko 
I don't know just randomly we never think about  
this just only now I I think about it after the 
buff I think ah no no yeah after the buff buff  
try but after play Geo and this looks good and 
yeah we keep going okay thank you very much you
hi Jack from GG Recon and my question is 
for Alex um with your French background  
as a an Honor European see it going around on 
Twitter this week um are you feeling the love  
from the EMA fans and and can we claim your 
successes our own I mean I mean I was born  
in France I only moved to Singapore when I 
was four years old so you could claim four  
years of yess I guess but uh I don't know 
like I I lived in Singapore all my life I  
I I'm French by Blood but I feel Singaporean so 
half half you know like okay sure can claim the  
coach half half half of it I mean we have one 
European player you know so sometimes people  
like to latch on to that but I think I think 
that's more relevant than me thank you thank
you hey guys another question here I made the same 
question to sadak on the last interview and if it  
applies to you as well we were discussing a little 
bit about Community toxicity right so when things  
go well and you are the winner everything goes 
fine the community is happy but if you do not do  
that and sadak said well we are going to end this 
series on forth and we are going to have a lot of  
backslash right we want to understand a little 
bit from you how do you feel about the community  
reactions and how do they make our lives harder 
especially when things do not go well I mean  
no yeah go ahead just uh I guess it's simple you 
need to understand who is this people who hate you  
in Internet who is this people I mean probably I 
don't want to say anything like really badly but I  
think they understand me and also after lose just 
try to never open Twitter and especially v. and  
also R also cannot open I mean I think you know 
in any situation you have people that like you and  
people that don't like you right so whenever you 
win the V the the the community that's actually  
talking is going to be the one that likes you if 
you lose the one that doesn't like you is the one  
that's going to talk you know and also the fact 
that internet has anonimity right so you can just  
say whatever you want and there's no repercussion 
to it um I think we just got to roll with the  
punches you know I think um this is just P parel 
you know I'm sure Cristiano Ronaldo like know  
Messi of people bashing them when they miss open 
goals you know I mean they don't do it they're  
that good but but I'm sure this happens you know 
so uh we're in the business of entertainment right  
and you know when people are not entertained 
they're not happy and there nothing we can do I  
think for us we just need to guard ourselves you 
know we I have younger players in the team you  
know and I have to police them you know sometimes 
they want to look every on I have to choke hold
them no so this one I'm trying to guard you 
know because he likes to look a little bit  
sometimes I just Pi this this afternoon 
I call him watching YouTube comments you  
know I like oh my god it feels it feels 
great when you win the match and you  
destroy some opponents and you up the GG 
but when you lost oh my God no canot so  
the best practice is just don't look at it 
you know ever awesome thanks you guys you're
welcome hi I'm elain from one orts and I have 
a question for Coach Alex so yesterday you  
mentioned that you were experimenting some 
new strategies against gen and it wasn't as  
effective was today going back to Old Reliable 
strats or did you tailor some new tactics to  
loud as well um honestly again we didn't 
really have much time so we just looked  
we just I think we just agreed to a game plan 
uh we tried yeah we tried to change a little  
bit you know we knew that you know like lot 
is incredibly intelligent team you know like  
probably the probably the most superable team 
in the whole league you know I mean and you  
know you're playing against one of the best 
IG in the world you know he's going to he's  
you know he walked into the a bomb side and asend 
the few few times and nobody was there you know  
and every time Les once in a while he'll be able 
to find a hole you know get a defense like just  
just by reading the game so I mean we just we 
just try our best to be aware of these things  
rather than like deling any strategies around 
it just I I don't think you can like out call  
them okay one more question um you talked 
about how everyone on the roster has been  
adapting to each other but in your opinion who 
has been the most consistent or reliable in this
process I mean
I wouldn't say most I think we didn't really have 
a great tournament you know so everybody's going  
up and down um I'm spe of of course special props 
to forsaken because usually he plugs the gaps and  
he still does a admirable drop every time he's 
put into these kind of situations um but I think  
they all they all really put a huge effort like 
just to sacrifice for each other which is quite  
commendable I think okay and lastly um the team 
was noticeably in a more relaxed playful mood  
today compared to yesterday so what contributed 
to this change I think every time we just like  
we know this this is the end of the line we just 
like really don't care about the play you know we  
just play for fun I think that's why we're like 
a bit more calm during this game like the day by  
day you know you wake up feels great everyone 
happy but second day G can cannot shoot there  
pressure you know like I think I think every time 
we we backs to the wall you know we're just like  
okay this is it we we're good going home or or 
we do something so good news every time backs  
the war we seem to be happier I don't know why but 
I guess it's the case okay thank you so much thank
you hello guys congratulations for the victory 
from son of KS my question is for forsaken um I  
have two questions for you the first one is having 
played already with all the regions in master uh  
with China with uh of course APAC and Americas 
what do you think that are their strong points  
and what do you think they are the what do you 
think are their U like weakest points and also  
what do you reckon or think that you as a team can 
learn from them or strong points and weak points  
yes of every region uh yeah for of of the team or 
of the regions that you face yes uh I mean every  
region they have like different play style of of 
course and maybe like na team or like uh China  
Regan they almost have like similar play style 
to our play style um I think the strong points  
is uh I I can do that yeah any any teams they 
may run better than most teams uh I think EMA  
teams they very good at trap play everywhere you 
go you just get hammered by like a bar of utility  
when they playing defense and the China regions 
just they're definitely the best aimers you know  
like I think better it's just that it's just that 
they're separated into very different teams right  
now they come up together and they gang up and 
we're going to have a problem shooting them back  
you know um honestly for weak points it's just 
I think I think I think honestly everyone learns  
from each other you know whenever we come to 
these coming events we take away something  
from the EM teams if we manage to scream or play 
matches against l or Sentinels you know we learn  
something uh luckily enough we can practice with 
a different region which is China from where we  
are so we don't actually learn much from them but 
there's a nice R for you know and we you know we  
lost this time and we we would like to like play 
up again and what do you think that you've learned  
most the most with for ah what do you think you've 
learned the most uh from playing with these teams  
this year um I actually think I think we learned 
the most um about like mentality mentality yeah  
about like just our self you know like focus on 
ourselves you know deal with ourself more better  
yeah something like that thank you congratulations 
and good luck tomorrow thank you thank you thank  
you thank you we'll take a few questions from 
remote media first question from Fernando uh  
thank you first of all congratulations guys on 
the win my name is Fernando I'm From valerant  
Zone from Brazil uh my question is for Alex uh 
following the idea of a friend in the room uh  
we all know how good something is on operator 
and we seen paper exchange compositions quite  
a while in this tournament uh can we see something 
playing jet on Sunset or asset maybe um well it's  
true that we change come a lot but usually 
actually right now we changing comes because  
we're struggling to make things work um on sun 
on Ascent I mean sunet sunset sunset is unlikely  
you know it's a race map but I've seen some good 
American some American teams play on jet and they  
and they play very I think it's oxygen actually I 
think I think he plays jet on and he has like very  
nice like floating he goes to very good angles you 
know I think it's incredible um we could you know  
we could I don't think it's a change that we will 
make this tournament for sure yeah I feel like  
it's not really jet map you cannot just get easily 
pick in okay and about Asen can we see him play  
on jet again in the future or in this tournament 
in the future it's about you you're the coach in  
the future yeah for sure depends on the come yeah 
depends on come this this r one sometimes master  
class sometimes class disaster class thank you 
very much guys good luck tomorrow and good luck  
in the rest of the tournament you next question 
from Razer hi I have two questions for Alex from  
the valerant competitive Community uh the first 
one and goes back to what you guys were talking  
about earlier with the map Pool um it feels like 
Rex's map Pool depth has been lacking so far this  
season compared to last year do you think this 
is mainly because you haven't had enough time to  
adjust to the roster change or are there other 
factors um such as meta changes like Sky Nerfs  
um that are the biggest cause of this and how 
confident are you that you'll be able to develop  
a deeper map pool for the rest of the season can 
this first but um for we were going to work on  
map regardless like all year round you know I'm 
very sure there'll be a new map halfway through  
the year is to be expected either something coming 
back you know unless one one of them come back um  
with regards to what was the first question what 
was the first question again sorry uh like why  
is the map P lacking depth yeah I mean I think we 
just got the wrong read on the meta you know like  
we decided to is I mean we decided to go away 
from Sky assuming that like we could replace it  
with Yu or Phoenix or some kind of flash agent 
but it turns out that you know the way we play  
sky enables us to play a lot more aggressively 
when we do this and because of that you know  
like we have to we we're scrambling right now to 
try and figure out who's going to play sky who's  
going to play what you know which is why the map 
looks weak um as you can see the only map that  
sky is not play on in Sunset you know and we're 
we're kind of comfortable on Sunset you know the  
rest of maps a lot of people play sky on and we're 
trying we're figuring out fig out there also like  
for us to pick up a new scan agent like halfway 
through tournament you know it's it's about the  
number of reps you have with the agent um however 
flexible you are you know it takes time to create  
ideas around it understand the agent understand 
how it works around the map understand how people  
react with the agent um it's it's not as easy 
as people think to just plug and play you know  
I can't I can't just like say oh today we going to 
run this com and it's going to look beautiful now  
it looks like whatever we've been playing for the 
last 10 days you know this is what it looks like  
like we we we don't have the depth of strategy and 
understanding to actually switch in and out like  
as when we want to especially so early in the year 
you know when we when we learning from when we  
learning how CH likes mon likes to play and stuff 
as well thank you and my last question is um the  
team has been regularly buying full into the bonus 
rounds is this a conscious decision from the team  
or is it just you wanting the players to keep the 
flow of momentum going because they're world class  
and definitely have a huge chance of winning I 
haven't really thought about it but I think it's  
also because we haven't been winning much bonus 
rounds you know we we've gotten quite few pistol  
wins this tournament which is honestly quite 
surprising because we usually do the opposite  
we win the bonus round and we play well in the gun 
rounds um we haven't been winning bonus runs and  
I think that's adding a little bit pressure on us 
to like okay we can't just run around with a with  
and and give them the round for free anymore 
you know because we can we're not we're not  
winning the gun rounds as as as comfortably 
as we normally do awesome thank you very
much next question from nerditude
Antonio thank you so much my question is for for 
second with Master Madrid this will be your e  
International classification with paperworks 
uh why do you think you have been able to be  
so constant with your work and team I would say 
because uh you know PX we like to like experiment  
a lot and then I like to being creative as well 
we Chang a lot of stuff a lot of strategy uh on  
the day itself so it's like uh I say I think 
we're just putting like all of like our brins  
to the map you know like every map so then 
people not going to like expect what we going  
to do later in the uh in the match you know so 
yeah thank you so much and congratulations thank  
you final question from Zen hello uh thank you 
and congratulations on your win uh this question  
goes to Alex uh in your own words yesterday you 
described the the team's performance as or rather  
the the experimentation as a disaster so how 
would you rate today's performance uh yeah in a
comparison I think today we played close 
to our best we can possibly get for this  
tournament like it would be it' be really great 
if we could like carry on this form I know it's  
hard you know because there a lot of factors but 
um this is as close as it gets for us you know  
like I think we read the game well we we we 
we made the Right Moves make it difficult for  
them to take space you know we challenged them 
at the right timings um we had good confidence  
we made some good confidence play you know to 
catch people of guard catch to keep the moment  
up we we did as well as we could you know I 
think the game still was very very close you  
know uh sorry one more question would you rate 
confidence as a defining factor for how you uh  
face loud today and you managed to take them 
down or did it come down to other factors as  
well you know what I think confidence for any 
like maybe sport or Esports you kind of thing  
it's it's a prerequisite you know for you to 
stand on the stage with such like talented like  
opposition if you if you if you're not ready to 
like fight them head on you know and you just you  
just have lost half the B already is a lot of 
like what we do is in the mind um I think it's  
one of the most important things yes all right 
thank you very much thank you very much that  
was the final question congratulations 
paper Rex we'll see you tomorrow thank
you
