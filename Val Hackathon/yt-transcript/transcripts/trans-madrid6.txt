if you have a question for the team please  
use a zoom hand raise feature we 
will start with in-person media
first uh hello guys firstly uh nice try today 
sorry for the loss this question is to anybody who  
would like to answer but uh I would appreciate it 
if uh JN or Klan could do it so his like this year  
so far your split the split has been one of your 
most dominant maps in terms of per performances  
and victories and today I felt like uh like 
looking at the game it felt like you weren't  
able to live up to your usual standard on the map 
so would you say it was something to do with the  
way gen played did they have the reads where were 
you anti-ed or just what happened on split today  
I think it's impossible to say who would have won 
it or whether it would have come down a strategy  
reads don't we didn't show up at all on that 
map we weren't playing and talking and you know  
our atmosphere wasn't okay and it wasn't how it 
usually is and there's stuff we can learn and I  
can learn and I could have done a lot better with 
to make sure that we didn't have that happen and  
we went in with the right atmosphere and then 
maybe we would have won split maybe we would  
have lost it and we could have given a better 
answer to what happened but with a score like  
that and you know what was happening behind the 
scenes there's just we had no chance okay thank
you hey guys I'm Andre from straf Sports uh I'm 
from Brazil so I'm going to ask the question in  
Portuguese for sassy but I'm only going to 
to give the overall question so everyone can  
understand so theough loss today we know that 
it was not the performance you all expected but  
going to the next game you can probably face 
loud as the third game of the same Series so  
we are we want to understand what does that mean 
in terms of preparation as you have faced each  
other twice already so I'm going to ask sass 
in Portuguese for this one ipond in Portuguese
see
[Music]
thank
you hi I'm alen from one Esports and and this 
question is for zelus so despite the outcome of  
the match your performance as killjoy on Lotus was 
impressive particularly in the later rounds with  
your use of the Odin so how do you maintain 
your composure in high pressure situations  
especially when playing killjoy first of all 
love the outfit thank you second of all uh I  
mean I just think the biggest thing is like the 
game's never over uh it doesn't really matter  
what round it is what the score is it's like 
you just always have to be in it especially  
in those High pressured matches um I mean I've 
been playing with the Odin a lot so I just I  
just love the gun I think it's op I think it's 
broken um yeah I I I don't really know how how  
else to answer that sorry okay um I have one 
more question um anyone can answer this so  
after facing off against loud numerous times in 
contrast to facing teams for the first time like  
jeni what would you say is more challenging 
a team you're familiar with or unfamiliar
with I mean it just depend on the team I'm like 
like it was easier to play as IM teams than uh  
J even though we're like infamiliar with 
versus loud but I just think just depends  
on the team really doesn't uh it's not like 
a specific there's no specific answer okay  
and lastly you're now looking into the 
lower bracket finals what vital steps do  
you take to make sure you bounce back and 
make it to that Grand Final rematch with
Juni I think we just need to make sure we 
play our game and our 100% tomorrow right  
there's not a lot of time to prepare and that 
you know not playing our game is why we lost  
today and we have to fix that we have we just 
need to go and confident every team you know  
whoever we play tomorrow is going to be really 
tired as well as us and there's just not going  
to be a lot of turnaround time to prepare 
for each other if it's loud we'll played  
each other so much that I just think it's 
going to come down to which team shows up  
so we're just going to make sure we get really 
good rest and get into our you know the right  
confident loose uh fun having head space we 
need to be to be at our best okay thank you so
much hello guys here T from SS of KS my question 
is for tens uh a little complimenting what um she  
just asked you uh I want you to tell me that what 
would you consider um could have happened uh while  
playing against geni that could have messed with 
your play style and like forced you to go to a  
third map and also having rounds that where where 
you you as a team were shown a little um like  
under performing I think the stylistic approach of 
gen they definitely group up a lot and so a lot of  
times when they're taking aggressive space they 
do it with high numbers so it was a lot harder  
to kind of take my ones and fight for space I know 
today I kind of had a very uncharacteristic match  
where I was kind of zoned out the entire time so 
definitely did not play that well and I'll take  
a portion of blame him for split just for that 
reason um but yeah I mean they're they're really  
good team and they work together and with their 
style I think they have it all figured out thank
you hello chck from GG Recon um commiserations 
on today I don't usually like doing post loss  
in uh questions but considering you guys aren't 
out yet and you've got another chance of moving  
forward and progress into the final and playing 
geni again um if it does come down to that rematch  
in the Grand Final what do you guys kind of think 
that would need to change in that matchup would  
it be map picks agent pool execution not suggest 
to anymore uh I think obviously they have a map  
Advantage because of the the two BS but for me 
it doesn't really matter as long as we show up  
on the server I think we literally didn't play 
map one we were absent map two it was okay but  
I think it was like 7 7% of our form and third map 
wasn't great obviously but we just need to show up  
pretty much doesn't matter like they might have a 
map Pool Advantage but I mean we're just playing  
valer we've played those Maps before as long as 
we're all ourselves we'll be fine I appreciate it
thanks all right well now move 
to remote media questions first  
question from Fernando uh hi guys 
sorry for the loss my question is for
Sassi
uh hello
hi okay try now yeah hello hi hello
hello hello okay uh hi guys 
sorry for the loss question
for
for
[Music]
good luck tomorrow guys thank you thank you thank 
you next question from arnob the spike hey guys  
com on the loss my question is for uh Kaplan uh 
this is the first time you have played geni uh  
but how how different do you think their play 
style is compared to others is it more complex  
uh from the outside while playing uh like it 
seems or is it uh more uh readable uh for you
guys
um think that there macro you're asking 
basically how do I how do we perceive their  
strategy compared to other opponents yeah 
yeah they're macro and micro yeah I think  
on a macro level they're not super complicated 
and they're more consistent from game to game  
right like you can you you know what to expect 
from them um they've shown that if you know if  
anyone watches their Maps back toback but on 
a micro level they're pretty unpredictable  
and right all those players are really good and 
they're really confident and they're not afraid  
to leverage that so uh I think that was something 
we were a little bit shook by in this series for
sure thank you next question from
chaku um hello guys ER my question is for 
kablan H the pistol rounds have been very  
K to the match many have been for geni what do 
you think has been the problem in the in that
dagar uh there's probably some pistol strategies 
that could have been better and I could have put  
more time into cooking and taking a little 
more time to talk about how to execute them  
with the team getting the team's ideas kind 
of sprinkled on top it's hard to maintain  
the same pistol quality because you have so 
much time to prepare your pistols before a  
tournament and then you're in the middle of a 
tournament and there's so much to focus on but  
that doesn't mean they can fall by the wayside 
and I do think they fell by the wayside some  
and that's on me so that's something that I 
have to fix and then there's obviously some  
pistols where crazy things happen right uh you 
know it there's not a lot of util sometimes it  
just come down as a gunfights or a ray hiding 
on a site that is sneaking around you never  
know but could have been a lot better and 
I'll make sure that they're a lot better  
moving forward okay thank you and good luck 
tomorrow thank you thank you next question from
Kus hey guys how you doing sorry about the loss 
um I have two quick questions for Kaplan um the  
first one is just um how come or I guess not 
how come but like what was the thought I guess  
behind letting through Breeze with the same 
comp you haven't had that much access on it  
obviously it doesn't really mean much since it's 
in a vacuum but that's wanted to ask about that  
yeah no regrets floating it but uh they play a 
pretty weird Style on the map and we watched it  
and felt like we could deal with it felt like it 
was exploitable and probably was wishful thinking  
to lean so hard into that with so little time 
to to plan the execution of that right and no  
time to be able to practice the execution there 
was no time for any scrims and then also you're  
you know if you're it's not just trying to play 
around their breeze it's trying to do it in the  
third map of an upper final where where there's 
a lot going on and we don't have comfort and I  
probably overconfident from myself and the team to 
go for that and I don't it's a learning experience  
I don't know I I don't I'm not going to say we 
regret doing it or I regret doing it but if I  
could go back in time and do it differently 
I might have we just yeah for sure that makes  
sense okay and then my my second question is 
just um yeah you do seem a little bit um like  
frustrated compared to normal I just wanted to 
ask you you did mention a few days ago about the  
the schedule stuff is that why you're frustrated 
now is that you don't feel like you have enough  
time to prep is that what the behind the scenes 
stuff is or is it something else yeah no not at  
all I was frustrated when that happened last time 
because I to this moment have I don't understand  
I don't think there was any good logical to me 
healthy for competitive Integrity reason that  
we were the first game when I was speaking out 
about it like what ever that was a week ago in  
this case it was inevitable there's no real way 
with the format to it was going to be a short  
turnaround for somebody today no matter what and 
you can't really prevent that without just making  
the tournament take a lot longer and just adding 
rest days in between everything and for obvious  
reasons that's not practical so no I don't blame 
right at all for uh us having a short turnaround  
yeah for sure awesome sorry about the loss guys 
good luck thank you thank you next question from  
Zen thank you uh considerations on your loss um 
this kind of question can go out to anyone on  
Sentinels I wanted to ask your thought on the 
series as a whole uh geni uh in general has a  
pretty aggressive style as you've sort of alluded 
to and they tend to group up together um what were  
sort of your expectations heading into the series 
against this style of com uh style of play as well  
as your anticipated answer against this aggression 
especially in terms of map control thank
you I mean we did watch their games and uh 
we're ready for their play style obviously  
sometimes we were like pretty surprised for 
example like they had KJ Al on LY and he just  
went through the orb go for a one for one so 
like did a lot of stuff like that that kind  
of like surprised us a bit but overall I think 
the loss is uh on us we had to win split and  
close on Lots but we just didn't show up on on 
split we uh will'll be pretty regretful about  
that but there there are a lot of lessons to 
learn there and we're just going to move on  
and take the loss and come back better but we 
I don't I don't feel like we got surprised by  
how they play at all thank you may I ask a 
follow-up question uh y thank you um if you  
were to potentially face gen G again um would 
you play this series differently in terms of  
Matt veto the way you approach the game or 
obviously you would um upgrade your game  
plan but yeah uh I mean my video wise we don't 
really have a choice right they have two bands  
we don't have any so it's going to be up to them 
to decide what they going what they want to ban  
and uh yeah we'll just adapt to that and pick 
what we like thank you very much thank you uh
Razer thank you very much um this is a question 
from the valerant competitive Community for  
John QT uh on map 3 Breeze it seemed like the 
plan wasn't to stack one site uh with all five  
players given Jeni's history on the map yet you 
continue with full main hits until nine rounds in  
this was quite different from the clever fakes 
against Lotus uh or on strategic rotations on  
splits attack half do you think this change in 
strategy helped play a big part in losing map
3 uh I mean map 3 we we wanted to to play 
Breeze because we had a read on them and  
we thought that playing that way would be 
good against their comp and their setups uh  
obviously didn't work out because of some 
small details uh there's I still I still  
need to rewatch The Game to really have a big 
bigger picture but yeah I think we just had a  
game plan we executed it didn't work out for the 
first half for the first half of the attack half  
and we just uh switched it up got three rounds 
and uh yeah we started defense lost pistol and  
after that it was hard thank you and then 
I have oh one more question for Kaplan and  
John okay what was the decision to let Breeze 
through for this match when there hasn't been  
much success with this comp was it just the 
amount of vods that existed for ice box and
sunset I can answer uh well it had nothing to 
do with ice box or Sunset because we we first  
banned ice box and they first banned Sunset 
so we let it through his decider those Maps  
weren't in the picture anymore the maps in the 
picture were ascent and binded and the breeze  
and they they they could pick between whichever 
two we leave open so I I think it goes back to  
what John said right we had a we had a plan 
we felt confident in our read um and we felt  
like we could exploit it and goes back to an 
answer I gave earlier could could you know was  
it overconfident to lean so hard into trying to 
exploit like there's always a balance right how  
do how do you want to anti and exploit another 
team and have a plan around them and how much  
you want to play your own game and how comfortable 
and confident is your own game on a map and it's  
a hard balance to strike it's hard to do it 
perfectly obviously I wish we did it perfectly  
and we're winning and weren't sitting here in 
a losers press conference but in this case we  
didn't strike that balance right and we lost 
in part because of that again I'm taking full  
responsibility for that at the end of the day 
if I'm the one that goes up there and does The  
veto it's it's my mistake and it it is what it 
is we have to learn but yeah it's kind of alls
too thank you thanks thank you final question from 
arnab hey guys uh obviously a loss in this type of  
format is very crucial given that uh there is no 
turnaround time but uh tomorrow you will be having  
uh a map Advantage I guess a beer Advantage 
for two maps so going through the series how  
like how do you guys prepare for those type uh 
these type of scenarios uh if it's papx loud uh  
loud whoever it is but what's the main game plan 
that you guys proceed with it's open for uh every
player could you it was was that directed toward 
me it was super hard for me to hear that I didn't  
hear any that question oh I can repeat if you want 
is it clear now uh can you talk some more hello is  
it clear now yeah can Okay so this question 
is actually open for everyone I just want to  
know that uh of course losing in such a CL uh a 
tournament like this is not ideal and it's very  
difficult to go in the turnaround time to prepare 
for your next match but given that I guess you  
guys will be having a v Advantage tomorrow how 
do you has prepare for the upcoming match for the
teams I think right now we are going to prepare by 
getting really good rest and making sure we come  
in in the right head space tomorrow and make sure 
we take the approach to game day that's worked  
best for us so far and trust that so probably 
means a little a little rest for all the guys  
and even a rest for myself and Drew and yeah 
I think we need to trust our own game tomorrow  
and just make sure we're we're in the right 
head space as a team and and just lean into  
that thank you guys and all the best for your 
tomorrow's mes thank you thank you thanks all  
right that was the final question thank you very 
much we'll see you tomorrow thank you bye thank
youate
