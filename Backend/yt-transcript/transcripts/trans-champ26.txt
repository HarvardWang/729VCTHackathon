hello everybody we are joined by 
Sentinels for coming off of their  
match against Heretics where's the where 
are you on the left I'm on the left on oh  
you're hiding yes um we will begin with 
questions from the remote media and then  
move to the in-house media uh we'll 
take the first question from Pedro
Romero hey guys uh first and foremost I got to 
give my uh thanks to you guys for giving us this  
time despite suffering this loss and subsequent 
elimination from this event uh a tough way to go  
down given the long road you guys have been on but 
still really appreciate you guys for making this  
happen that said I'm going to send out the first 
question over to to Kaplan um obviously looking  
over into into the entire series overall you guys 
started off with on Haven then things started to  
change obviously in the second and third map uh 
of the series but still I ask to you uh at what  
point in time in the series do you feel the team 
or more more so the momentum started to shift  
from it being um sentinel's favor to that being 
heretic's favor and why do you think uh such a  
shift happened um I mean they're first of all 
they're a very good team and they played very  
good valerant and it was a very hard game to play 
I'd say we lost momentum toward the end of ice  
box right there was a lot of unfortunate rounds 
there was very close rounds there's rounds where  
we were in control and something unfortunate 
happened and other points we were in control  
and we caused something unfortunate to 
happen and that stuff just piles up and  
we definitely lost momentum there I think 
we did a good job resetting going into map  
three in terms of like energy momentum 
like confidence where that stuff's at  
it just was a very hard abyss and uh we 
obviously struggled strategically on that
map thank you we'll take the next question 
from Sierra frisbee yeah hello uh first off  
considerations on your loss um my name is Sierra 
zobi just a freelance commentator um my question  
goes to Z it's actually about one of those 
Turning Point rounds on ice boox because a lot  
of people on broadcast and just me as a viewer 
was wondering as we watched um Round 19 uh it  
was right after your last major timeout and you 
guys opened up the round beautifully taking you  
know yellow with a pop flash from tens and you're 
able to find the first player but then when you're  
transferring on to mini boo you have like a full 
freeze kind of moment and get visibly frustrated  
on the player cam I just kind of no know what 
happened like was it Tech related or just what  
ended up happening because it kind of is what led 
to the eventual loss of the round later on over  
on a uh I accidentally brushed over my Windows key 
when I was trying to hit control to uh Crouch when  
I was trying to control my spray so um my game 
all tabbed um it was unfortunate but uh probably  
on me to not get as as visibly upset happens it 
happens yeah it happens but um yeah it was just  
an accident and uh a tough time to 
have an accident like that but uh  
it's Sor right it's all right yeah know 
it all happens thank you we'll take the  
next question from SN from Sports ke hey 
guys likewise commiserations reporing in  
progress uh my question goes to 10 so this 
was your second appearance at Champs and I  
just wanted to know what your biggest takeaways 
are from the overall event and this 2024 season
I mean overall for the 2024 season I'm super 
proud of the team the rest of the guys for  
the hard work that we put in uh what we were 
able to do in uh Madrid and also for kickoff  
um sad that it didn't end up in a in a uh 
first place finish here at Champs but you  
know what it's better than my last appearance at 
Champs so that's all that matters to me and no  
regrets just Vibes thank you thank you we'll 
take you uh we'll go next to Andre from PR
Esports oh sorry yeah ER good evening guys 
sorry for the loss and my question goes to  
Sassi we know that you and aspas are very best 
friends he wanted to be able to play against  
you but tics denied this opportunity all of you 
and S fans asked him to be crew to qualify for  
Champions so do you have anything to ask him 
for after this defeat a Revenge maybe wait for  
who sorry to aspas ER yeah aspas aspas is your 
friend and he he beat that crew so hard to make  
you qualifi Champions that's true that's true 
I forgot about that uh Al I'll be just chewing  
for him you know uh I hope he gets his second 
tournament um and I mean he's the goat that's it  
you so much thank you we'll take the next question 
from arnab hey guys likewise commiseration on the  
loss uh my question is open for everyone uh I 
just want to know your experience how it has  
been playing under uh John C's igl throughout 
this season when he came to the team and how  
how you guys have been seen him uh progress 
throughout the year uh anyone can CH in Chim  
in into it I can answer everyone I want to 
go too um I think what John did this year is  
basically like I can I can say that it's kind 
of impossible to be honest uh being igl for  
Sentinels that's a big org with a rast of like 
Star players and uh on his rookie year I think  
he did a pretty good damn job so DRS to him 
I think he worked really hard with Kaplan and  
Drew they work together really hard this season 
and you know we got to Trophies we got top four  
and in my opinion I think he he can be satisfied 
by it and work hard for next season that's it um  
as is duelist like having a rookie igl come in 
and um just kind of like exceed expectations I  
think he did a lot better than anyone could have 
expected or hoped from him and um makes my life  
lot easier to to play especially when I believe 
in the calls and the caller so having a having  
someone like him makes it makes everyone 
else's lives easier so it's just a really  
good call thank you we had a question submitted 
thank you Wars my heart this is my win of
tonight sorry about that um we did have 
a question submitted it's a little bit  
future facing it's from the time media uh it's 
looking ahead to Masters Bangkok uh two Park  
question uh are you aware that you 
have a large fan base in Thailand  
uh if so how do you feel about that and 
is there anything you'd like to share to  
the fans in Thailand who are looking 
forward to seeing you guys at Masters
Bangkok uh shout out to the 
fans uh we'll be there no matter
what thank you uh we'll go 
back to Pedro for the next
question yes I want to Circle back on kaplan's 
answer um in the start part of this press  
conference you mentioned a little bit about Abyss 
uh interesting uh uh um selection or due to the  
map votes this for this match given the fact that 
you guys have not played any Abyss at all um this  
year up until this moment uh this series just 
want to know from your point of view um what  
exactly led to um it being that way you know uh 
opting for playing for Abyss for um for today
yeah uh obviously we've worked on one people could 
see that from the vetos right we haven't been  
first Banning it and sometimes we don't second 
ban it we let it through uh yeah we worked really  
hard on one I mean we worked really hard on Abyss 
for over a month and a half I I I'm not going to  
sit here and say we loved the map and that it went 
great in scrims it was one of the more frustrating  
maps for us to work on it's pretty frustrating 
for me I've think I've done a fairly good job  
working with teams on clicking with maps and this 
it's a tough map it's a frustrating map and it  
was hard for us to click with it um I do think 
we walked into this match feeling pretty good  
about it I'm definitely not gon to sit here and 
say we felt great about it but we needed to show  
it eventually we needed to have an abyss ready 
for Grand finals for loser final um you know  
it was going to show up eventually uh ultimately 
they chose to go there instead of a scent so uh  
I actually think that we played a decent game on 
it uh I think it's I think it's hard to come into  
such a high pressure Series in top four having 
not played the map yet it is an advantage that  
we didn't show it but it's also difficult to 
have never played a match on a map and play a  
team that has it's just hard to feel comfortable 
as a team and yeah it's just a difficult situation  
and I'm proud of the attempt we gave it 
uh Pedro did you have a followup as well
yes I did but it's more so to to a different 
person if you don't mind me asking yeah this  
one goes to zelis um obviously you've been 
an integral uh player uh teammate member  
of the squad for this entire year um through 
yeah from start to finish um I remember in a  
conversation that I had with Sassi before to 
start a kickoff when he kind of talked about  
how much of an important role you played 
into the team you can really describe  
it but um uh as this year transpired you 
know we definitely saw flashes of that I  
do understand that you are disappointed right 
now and and having absorbing this defeat but  
um more specifically asking you zus how do you 
kind of look back on just your contribution to  
the team and just how the team's kind of been 
fairing from kickoff up until the very end
um I mean I'm really proud of the team uh they you 
know they trusted me a lot this year um inside of  
practice outside of practice even like you know 
their Lifestyles they have done really good jobs  
of being just better humans overall for themselves 
um and it's a really really good year like we you  
know we won Madrid top four Champs we had a 
rocky split too but I think like overall like  
I'm pretty happy and I'm really proud of 
the team and what we've done and um yeah  
I'm just glad that you know they allowed me 
to be a part of this squad and roster and  
you know going forward I'm you know 
definitely excited to push for more
trophies thank you we'll go next to nerditude
thank you so much hi I'm from nud um first 
of all what a great year you guys had and  
congrats of making it is for the question is 
for CIS you always learn something from loses  
so what do you learn from this one and how 
do you plan to come back next year oh [ __ ]  
hopefully now I have one kill on the third math 
elimination Abyss um um I mean it's always like  
it it's always sucks to lose especially sometimes 
with how you lose but um I think we've proven so  
many people wrong this year um you know all of us 
the team everything I think like the major thing  
is that you know we we got top four at Champs 
and people expected us to not even be here people  
expected us to get grouped um so I think the main 
thing for us is you know to process this loss but  
you know it's Esports and you always have to get 
back to the drawing board no matter what so so  
I think that's just what I'm looking forward to 
now thank you so much thank you we'll go next to
arnab uh hi again it's not just a question just 
I think I speak for every fans uh out there  
in the world that uh you guys did create this 
season uh whether it's individual performance  
or anything and zus we don't like seeing you 
sitting like this we always see you smiling and  
happy so please keep doing that and please keep 
entertaining others as well thank you thank you  
thank you um we'll take the next question from 
Sierra yeah no I Echo the same sentiment like  
you inane map to Elis um I think to be a shame 
for for having one wrap them up but I did have  
a question and it's it's forward looking and 
it can go to anybody on the team um this may  
be the end of the VCT season but the off 
season seems pretty stacked for you guys  
with Red Bull H ground The Sentinel show match 
and those teams haven't been revealed possibly  
Le xter is there any specific event any of you 
guys are looking forward to competing in Robert  
I haven't seen my family in years please 
please is this the end of the Chocolate
Factory I'm excited for the uh Seattle one 
I lived there for six years most of my 20s  
and it's an incredible beautiful city 
I'm very excited that it I'm in right  
now yeah it's an I'm I'm jealous 
of you uh I'm excited that it's  
going to host a valent event um and I 
think that everybody will enjoy it a
lot thank you uh we'll take the next question from
Solara hello guys obviously commiserations on 
the loss and elimination but I think it's been  
a great run and thank you for your performance at 
this event uh my question is to is like two part  
my first uh question is to Klan uh love the tweet 
that uh no one can take this year from you so um  
my first question is uh could you please uh wrap 
up this here and tell like what are you most proud  
of uh like which thing you're most proud of when 
it comes to the team and the journey you've been
true I am most proud that nobody ever gave up on 
each other it was a really hard year and it was  
a lot of it's a very long year with a lot of hard 
work and a lot of very frustrating points and some  
eye points but it's easy to forget him and it's 
really easy to get really frustrated as a team um  
and it's really easy to absolutely be pissed and 
angry and upset and anything else when losing uh  
and even after the most frustrating points uh 
and the toughest losses we somehow bounc back  
every single time and that just would never 
have been possible if uh every single person  
on the team wasn't able to stay continuously 
believing in one another and our ability as a  
team uh and and that's not easy to do with the 
amount of hours and time and stress and effort  
everyone puts in and sometimes uh people were 
so so so frustrated and tired of each other but  
they still believed and they were still able to 
push through it and it was all love in the end  
and I'm I'm just incredibly proud of everyone 
on the team for that I think that's what one  
of the reasons why s City fans love you so much 
guys and uh my second part is to the players uh  
if anyone wants to say like uh what are you like 
the most proud of like uh concerning this season
I didn't understand the question sorry English 
is bad could you repeat it sorry uh so the second  
part is the to the players like uh looking back 
at the season uh like what's one thing that you're  
most proud of and what you're taking away with 
you to 2025 I have something but I don't want  
to go first go first um I'm really proud of this 
Champs tournament um in comparison to my last one  
I was talking to Tyson about this earlier but 
like in 2022 when I went to Champs with exet I  
didn't have the highest expectations for myself 
I was really nervous going into games I didn't  
think I was going to do great and then if I had 
a good game I'd be like oh my God oh my God and  
I'd freak out about it because I didn't expect 
that for myself um this tournament um except for  
the first gen game because I got pooped on um 
I came into every game with the mentality that  
I'm probably the best player in the server and 
I should play like it and um just like the level  
of confidence now compared to back then is so 
much higher and um I'm really proud of that for
myself um I mean it's probably easy to say m 
Madrid obviously but I'm actually very very proud  
of this tournament to be honest uh we weren't 
even meant to be here and uh we still got top  
four and we got very motivated and then got to the 
hardest group probably and we didn't give up still  
and we lost against JG in a terrible loss 02 and 
we still didn't give up and we kept pushing like  
everyone like doubted us thought we were just 
like done for we just we just kept pushing then  
like we kind of dropped the ball against EDG and 
the next day we just kept pushing and just like  
it's not all like rainbows and like everything's 
looking good in the pr room a lot of problems in  
the pr room and uh we just kept pushing and 
kept pushing till we couldn't anymore and uh  
I mean we just did our best till the last 
round like even the last round we're down  
we just were like we believed the whole time 
and that's what I'm going to take from this
tournament thank you love you guys and good 
luck and the next season thank you for those  
questions thank you thank you uh we got 
a question from the newest member of the  
press Corp hey guys um I don't actually 
have a question I just wanted to say  
I know it sucks right now but you guys played a 
hell of a [ __ ] game and I hope that you can be  
proud of yourselves even though it's kind of 
like pretty difficult right now you guys got  
top four at Champs um Heretics are probably 
gonna win it all hopefully I jinx them and  
they don't um but I want to to say nice try 
and uh you guys got to keep your heads up  
it's going to be okay and uh good [ __ ] [ __ ] 
out there thank you thanks Big T you're looking
huge thank you uh we'll go next to Fernando 
from game arena thank you very much hi guys  
sorry for the loss and congrats on 
the season uh F brail here my question
for
for
for
for fore
thanks guys good luck at next season thank you 
thank you thank you uh and Pedro would you like  
to close us out yeah uh this question goes out 
to T or anyone else that would like to answer  
um after I ask this question uh obviously you 
mentioned a little bit about 2021 the sentinel's  
last appearance and yeah from that point to now 
I mean as everybody knows the story kind of had  
to to go through the do drums to emerge out of it 
and become a new version of yourselves and a new  
and be a part part of a new version of the team uh 
and for this year this team did did exactly that  
um as sassy mentioned winning a masters winning 
a trophy in Americas this season um that said You  
know despite losing today uh finishing top four 
and you know being two steps away from reaching  
finals and possibly winning the the title at the 
very least you guys have a blueprint for next year  
and have an idea of what are the kinds of things 
that you guys want have to do have to adjust have  
to work on have to tweak have to just I'm kind of 
repeating myself at this point but still you get  
you get what I'm saying that said my question to 
you um is this as you guys now look ahead towards  
2025 what do you think is the most important thing 
that the team kind of has to look at now and say  
okay if we guys if us five and Catholic does this 
then now we're going to be at a better position  
going forward for our next attempt in Champions 
next year I ain't thinking about that right now  
and I don't want to we had a really nice run and 
I'm proud of us and I'm I'm I'm GNA celebrate  
it and uh I have a million thoughts but I'm I'm 
Gonna Save him for another time so that's that's  
where I'm at personally I think the the biggest 
thing for us was coming into this year from the  
last year we were not not a great team at all 
and you were amazing what do you mean okay um  
but just being able to level up our play and grow 
as a team and become this really bad team into a  
team that can actually contend for titles I think 
was the most important thing uh for this year in
general Sentinels thank you so much for taking the  
time to speak with us today thank 
you thank you thank you good night
