we are to to have both of the teams 
here to share the stocks uh that's  
was an experience from today match uh so 
we're going to start uh with fanatic uh  
we are going to open with one question here on 
the audience is from SOA ah no okay so we are  
going to open the uh Mick or the media that 
attending online so Brandon from esport GG  
thank you very much uh this one will go to Boer 
you know you guys have played uh DRX a handful  
of times at Champions now um it's been a while 
I guess to say you know valer is not a new game  
anymore you've been there since the beginning 
with summon FC into fanatic now I'd just like  
to ask your thoughts on kind of the the Legacy 
teams that we're seeing here is what we'll call  
them at Champions you guys you know crew DRX teams 
that have made it you know to Champions a handful  
of times compared to some of the newer teams 
we're seeing rise up this year like Heretics  
and geneng just like to get your thoughts on sort 
of the state of valerant with the mix of experienc  
players and newer players showing what they've got 
this year yeah I think it's a a common occurrence  
uh with like you get the fresh blood in and then 
uh you mix it up with some people that have a  
little bit of experience normally they go into the 
igl role or like a a less flashier role but it's  
it's nice to have a mixture of two because uh it 
if you you keep with the oldies it's it's hard for  
them to stay motivated or uh recording in progress 
um it's hard for them to say motivated or you  
know remember what it's like to be hungry and you 
bring in a fresh blood and like they they kind of  
remind you of that so I think yeah it's good you 
know um and I think the people that stay in the  
scene the longest are the ones that are able to 
maintain their like motivation or uh their hunger
thank you sir for your 
answer next questions is from
fundo sorry I forgot I was mute H hi 
guys I'm fakun Dominguez F the news my  
my question is going to for chronicle 
uh during during the second map ER  
the Chamber of the was something that during the 
imia season wasn't seen enough and it wasn't like  
you weren't so comfortable fighting against 
that pig that asan ER what are your thoughts  
on how the team performed during the second map 
I don't think chamber was that strong against us  
I think at the start of Defense side we struggled 
a little bit because we had a wrong game plan how  
to play around all the stuff they do and after we 
switched it back to the normal like what we do in  
like most basic stuff we we I think we almost 
every round punish him for being aggressive on  
a and he didn't do that much and on attack side 
we also like kind of knew how he will do against  
us so he didn't do that much too but still he 
got some op frags he got some good entries and  
of course I mean I can't deny that on the start 
of Defense side he was pretty much strong like he  
want some rounds by just controlling the whole a 
against us and that was strong but okay we adapted  
and I think more problems it was like how they 
were playing together and how for example their  
race was executing some sides she did a great 
job like bus was playing well so it props to
him thank you so much uh next next question is 
from arnab hey guys commiseration on the loss  
this question goes to boster uh during the pre uh 
event press conference I I guess uh you said that  
you were interested to see how Marco will be doing 
his igl role uh since now you have played against  
him uh you being one of the most experienced IG 
in this game how would you say he faced against  
you guys and how difficult was uh his G plan 
to read for you guys particularly I think he  
definitely shot better than me today um so there's 
that uh in terms of what they were doing I think  
honestly I just think if we play them again 
now now that we've we've played it I think it  
will be a different like I'm I I think we'll be 
more ready uh I think today we just didn't show  
a very good game um and we weren't the yeah 
we just weren't really listening sometimes  
important moments and little micro erors you 
know uh I don't think they did anything that  
special I think on both abyss and Lotus we knew 
roughly where they were and where they were going  
uh by like maybe one or two three rounds I'd 
say we just didn't really know what to do um  
which is fair enough uh but I think if you if 
you want to win the trophy um uh we have to we  
have to get quick at reading what's going on on 
the map and Al getting comfortable but I think  
today was a good learning you know our Abyss we 
finally got to play it we saw probably what was  
going WR with it and we try and fix it for next 
time and then with the Lotus as well has been a  
while since I played against an Ora um and yeah 
we were getting a little bit abused uh but then  
we slowly we figured it out on defense and then 
it was too late and then on attack it was like we  
we we started a bit slow and I think next time we 
play them we'll be ready for that too if it comes  
to that map and stuff so yeah I think M did really 
well uh uh it's hard being an igl but I think next  
time we play them uh we're going to be more ready 
thank you just a small followup on this uh we have  
been seeing Astra a lot right now in especially uh 
how do you see her in the current meta and do you  
still see her as viable in other Maps um I think 
at the end of the day at the end of the day uh you  
you you've got to shoot heads and there's not much 
difference between Astra and Omen I think Omen is  
better on some maps um uh but if if you're feeling 
comfortable on the Astra instead then go for that  
instead and that's kind of how uh we we were 
thinking and um yeah normally I'd have a better  
game on the Astra but uh yeah that map ain't my 
map sometimes uh and yeah today it wasn't uh yeah  
I think it's fun to play Astra but she I think 
she's not as she's not super super strong you  
have to just be quite disciplined with her and the 
way you use her utility you can't just throw it  
around like you can do with other agents you have 
to be very frugal which isn't fun thank you guys  
and all the best for the next match thank you you 
uh next question is from Cara uh hello hello uh
so this question is for Coach uh in the map 
one arbis uh you CH a a very anuro comp other  
than uh than than other teams so uh what do you 
think of using choosing Euro as a dualist but  
not choosing Cipher or instead uh but not but 
choosing uh kjoy instead of Cipher to be the uh
Sentinels uh I mean yoru I think Derk is probably 
the best yoru player in the world and I think that  
yoru has a lot of utility and a lot of just extra 
stuff he can do over a jet obviously doesn't have  
the verticality which is quite useful on that map 
but I think that the euru the roru pick is there  
um to give us a bit of a different look I 
think it makes sense on that map and the  
kill Dr versus Cipher I think they both have 
a lot of benefits and a lot of weaknesses um  
obviously you saw them using the cipher lot 
and attack to lurk into make that pressure  
in Middle on us which I think we struggled to 
deal with um but I think the the kill dra is  
also good I mean Alpha got got some kills off 
the Nanos and stuff on defense so I think it  
just just depends on what the rest of your comp 
looks like and what you want to combo with uh
CER thank you thank
you okay uh that's all uh thank you 
for ins for being here today your  
determination and sportmanship 
are commendable we look forward  
to seeing your future matches 
and success thank you thank you
