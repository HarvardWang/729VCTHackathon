we are joined by paper x who are coming 
off of their match against G2 uh please  
use the zoom hand rais function and then we 
will call on you let us begin with strafe
sports hi guys first of all I would like to say 
sorry for the loss thank you this question is for  
this question is for all of the players and the 
coach so you guys picked G2 for the first for this  
match up in the playoffs so I would like to know 
what was the thought process behind that pick and  
also were there any expectations you had from the 
match that were or were not met from this match
up um I mean there wasn't really much to 
point to it we we just thought that we had  
a good game against them turns out that 
they are really really good and it was  
a bit difficult for us expectation wise I 
mean we expect to play better pretty much
all right thank you thank you we'll go to 
sports keer next yes uh conversations on  
the loss my question is for Alex uh while the 
first two maps had their fair share of ups and  
downs the third one ended up feeling a lot 
more one-sided and somewhat unsynchronized  
at times what do you think allowed for 
G2 to have such a dominant hold on bind
specifically I think we just couldn't stop them 
you know like um good combo of utility uh the  
executes and we couldn't stop the entrances we 
were losing our gunfights you know when this  
happens you know nothing much you can do I think 
we over rotated a bit too much we we didn't play  
our game as well as we can and it shows in the 
score line thank you and good luck on your next  
match thank you thank you we'll go back to 
strafe ESP Sports for the next question hi  
this question is for Jing so now that you've 
been back in the team how and obviously this  
match didn't go as expected for you 
guys but how does it feel to be back  
on the international stage once mean 
it definitely feels great to be back  
on stage CU I haven't played for really 
long so yeah I mean it was a really fun
game thank you we'll now 
take any questions from the
room I have two questions the first question goes 
for Jane as a crazy race player after the weekend  
of race do you think it will affect you a lot or 
you prefer to try more different agents I mean I  
have to see what like what they going to do to 
race first and see if it's still viable if it's  
not viable then I have to play the stuff okay 
the second one is for something from high sense  
to know what click on you made the change uh more 
consistency when I play on L tournaments thank you  
we have a question from Pedro I'll go to Pedro
next hey guys uh likewise commiserations on the 
series got a question for uh forsaken going a  
little bit off of what Alex said regarding the 
team's issues against G2 um in the server uh  
what was your impression of uh your opponent 
and also uh what was the biggest challenge for  
you in terms of just facing them and everything 
that they brought to the table uh I mean I think  
Alex just told me like just play your game and 
then just like try to focus on your on your a  
first rather than like your utility maybe he has 
a good point and I think about G2 I think for them  
I think I would say they really um sharp I think 
especially like on B we don't have like momentum  
to beat them they they have like a good strategy I 
would say all the utility like on point to day so
yeah uh we'll go to stra sports it seems they 
have one more question yeah this is the final  
question from my side so your upcoming matchup 
would be against either EDG or team heretic so  
this question is for all the players and the 
coach which which team from the two would you  
be willing to face in the next matchup and 
do you have any expectations from that as
well I think personally for me I would love 
to play EDG I guess we they us last time and  
now we have a chance to meet them again but 
obviously her is fine as well but yeah I mean  
I would love to play EDG and yeah hopefully we 
able to be ourself again for the next match and
yeah all right thank you very much and all 
the best for your upcoming matchup thank you
uh we have one more question from 
Grill news go ahead thank you my  
name isi I'm fortunately you didn't 
have a good performance against the  
other team today what do you think was 
the most difficult obstacle you face
today probably I think when it comes 
to us it's always about DM I guess  
I guess he wasn't there and also our 
teamw not as good I would say in bind  
I mean overall they beat us obviously like what 
for second mention like they have a very good  
aim and also I think their teamwork was very 
very good compared to us so I think there a  
reason why we are not ourself today but yeah I 
mean overall it was a tough match I would say  
thank you paper Rex thank you so much for 
taking the time to speak with us thank you
