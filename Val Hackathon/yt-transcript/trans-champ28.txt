okay uh welcome back everyone for 
the next El we have here uh tics  
congratulations guys uh for your Victory 
and reaching of uh Champion Soul now we  
open the floor for question from the 
media first question is from H Pedro
Romero hey guys uh allow me to be the first to 
congratulate you guys for making it to the Grand  
finals of Champions an incredible achievement 
uh given the long road you guys have tooken  
from the start of 2024 up until now job all 
done of course job is not done yet um still  
focusing on today Gotta Give My my question over 
to Neil Zeno um you mentioned a little bit uh in  
the postmatch interview you had with yinu ailos 
and in the in the broadcast this and you talked  
a little bit about how um you kind of compared 
um facing aspas to to facing like other duel  
S as safe uh you you mentioned about uh how 
playing against aspas is manageable I might  
be wrong you can kind of correct me on that 
still um I want to know what was the game plan  
behind approaching a player like like aspas and 
the rest of latan with that in mind and how was  
the game plan successful yeah I think for that 
like aspas is obviously an incredible player and  
you have to respect him uh basically what I was 
saying is I mean I compared him to someone like  
safe right like with safe he's exposive he's 
unpredictable uh he's very hard to he's very  
hard to like prepare for because he plays 
on his feelings and he'll you know take a  
time in and he's incredible at doing it and you 
can just split your site in half um whereas ASP  
pass is a lot more calculated and if you watch 
him which me and Weber did and Boo as well uh  
you can manage him right like we've got good 
utility we can push him back we know he's not  
going to take Pi risky engagements he's quite 
calculated so yeah he's not the kind of the  
player to just send an insight and try win 
the game by himself you know which makes him  
dangerous as well in his own way but I think 
we learned a lot from playing him the first
time thank you so much next question is from
fako he guys can you hear me yeah 
yeah well my question is for any  
wants to answer uh such a long road in the in the 
lower bracket you've done so far uh now looking on  
on tomorrow match uh how how do you see the the 
stamina after this match will affect uh tomorrow
can I answer I think yeah me personally like 
my stamina is still full you know like every  
single time I play the game in Arena I want 
to play more and more so tomorrow I will be  
more motivated and more energetic I don't know 
about my teammate but I believe they're also  
kind of same because we love playing officials 
we need to talk about opening ceremony as well  
it's going to be a cool one so yeah I we good I 
think for the stamina like we just make sure we  
don't I don't know don't waste energy on useless 
things like social media or I know thinking com  
my God oh my God is soon then you think a lot 
and what if not like I just come we play um  
once we're done we go home then we come play 
again like it's as simple as that for us for  
us because like if you over think and if you 
waste energy on other things then yeah it's  
going to be tough but I think all of us are 
making sure we just are focused on the game
only cool yes thanks so much thank you for your 
answer uh next question is from Sierra FZ hello  
Sierra just freelance sports caster here um my 
question can go to anybody that would like to  
answer but NE you know it might be good for 
you um you kicked off your VCT Champion Soul  
Jour Andy with a very close match against 
fpx where you nearly won I think it was 50  
13 OT on map 3 and now your final VCT Champion 
Soul match will be grand finals against the  
number one team from China obviously EDG uh 
what do you think are some main differences  
between EDG and FP access teams and opponents 
and in what ways have you guys changed do you  
think since that uh opening group stage match 
I think all the Chinese teams are very strong  
in their own way I think ug have improved a lot 
from uh Shanghai when we played them last time so  
for me it's a completely different team that 
we played in Shanghai I'm expecting it to be  
a very good match and we are going to have 
to be at our best to win to be honest like  
there's no easy games in Champions right so it 
was the same with fpx it's going to be the same  
with EDG uh every literally every single game 
we've played every single game that anyone's  
played at this tournament has been a battle 
there's not been any walkovers you know so  
yeah for me there's not I don't want to give 
too much away but we're expecting a very good
game thank you for your answer next question  
is from Brandon awesome thank you 
congrats guys this is Brandon with
esports.com
and teams since the very beginning and this is 
the first time since the very first Champions  
that we're seeing in a Mia team in the Grand Final 
and obviously the first time we're ever going to  
see a Chinese team in the Grand Final uh so I'd 
just like to ask you kind of your thoughts on the  
evolution of the game including the kind of fresh 
blood Talent we're seeing and how that compares to  
uh you know where things were a couple years ago 
where was very naad dominated and now we're seeing  
uh these new faces step up and take the spotlight 
yeah it's interesting I think like I mean me and  
Weber uh are other coach like I was in a team with 
him years and years ago as well like we played in  
like 2011 I was as he was also a young Talent at 
one point you know and it's always something that  
I preferred uh I think it's nice having you know 
fresh blood coming through and it was something  
I always focused on when I was in igl NCS like 
I always liked surrounding myself with you know  
just hungry hungry players and I think that's just 
what you're seeing now you know I think the game's  
evolved a lot um and that's all that's happening 
that you're just getting a fresh outlook on things  
I feel like at the start of valerant there was 
maybe you know a lot of Cs players coming in  
with very strong opinions on how the game should 
be played and they took a lot of things from CS  
and it's not bad like it's still very valid but 
now you're getting you know like fortnite noobs  
like Benji and stuff they don't have any like 
set way of it's just like a fresh outlook on  
the game they're literally there's people that 
are only playing valerant like you know and it's  
like they're all just they've played valerant 
and that's mostly it so they play valerant they  
don't play any other game and they're very easy to 
develop and very open-minded so I think that's is  
it's just fresh players coming in they're hungry 
to win and yeah that's why we're seeing a change
now thank you so much uh 
next question is from Antonio
summer thank you so much um I am Anon sum from 
nerud and my question is for neilo now that you  
know your opponent opponent in the final is 
there anything about them that that concerns  
you or that you consider your biggest challenge 
n not really man uh we've had the same outlook  
on every single uh Team we've played every single 
team I think I've said it like a lot of times now  
they're all incredible teams they're all very very 
strong teams they've all got star players you know  
like your ASP pass uh you got K Kang like they're 
all incredible players so we just want to focus  
on ourselves and you know just focus on the next 
game like I I've said it in most of these press  
conferences like we don't Focus too much on who 
we're playing against we just want to take each  
game at a time and we just have one more left now 
so that's the focus for tomorrow thank you so much  
and good luck thank you you thank you thank you 
now we have uh two pres submitted questions uh the  
first one is from Main uh this is for anyone on 
the team is in game three leevan bro the score to  
one to how much this this affect your confidence 
knowing that one more game could have ended the
match I don't think it affected our 
confidence um it's a game you win you  
lose we lost a map doesn't mean that we're 
going to lose the next two or something um  
so you just refreshed they played well on the 
Beast um Harbor is was hard to play against  
um but then there is next map so we just focus 
on the next map there is nothing we could have  
changed anymore so we just go next thank you so 
much uh there is a another question is in Thailand  
there is a joke going around that team tics is 
representing Thailand because the privation th  
also stand for Thailand how do you feel about 
that thanks to my friend in the Thailand
we love you
all yeah it's funny it's nice I think we met 
them after Shanghai right like a lot of the  
um I think it was like producers and stuff 
from the Tha broadcast and they're asking  
the same question it was pretty fun they were 
super nice so yeah I mean next year's uh Master  
season t no yeah yeah so it's going to be fun 
if we participate yeah we will be D in the
th thank you uh we have another question this is 
from the standard uh question for Benji yeah you  
and your team have once again reached the Grand 
Final how do you cope with the disappointment  
from the final that Master Shanghai and what 
made your team stronger to reach the finals  
again um I mean losing in Shanghai obviously 
sucked and I think all of us probably learned  
stuff about ourselves um like individually 
and also we learn a lot about us as a team  
I think we I mean we all hate losing like every 
person that competes hates losing but the only  
thing that makes you stop losing is learning 
from the mistakes you make when you lose and  
I think that's what we've done and which is and 
it's what got us here now um I mean the thing is  
I feel like when we play like ourselves we are 
the best team in the world and I think that's  
what we didn't do in Shanghai in Grand finals 
so we just we're just going to make sure we do  
that again or not not not the same as Grand finals 
yeah for me losing in shangai was really also very
sad okay thank you uh next question is uh for 
Benji and miniu is how does having aute BL uh  
A Plus on the table during a gameing affect 
your confidence or belief in the competition  
what having a plushy on the stage yep
uh I mean it's just a plushy there's no meaning to 
it like I carried a plushy for my mother because  
she gave me on like Easter uh celebration and 
I just bring it for her you know and there is  
no like confidence behind it I guess it's just 
a chicken I mean for me I just w out with the  
hat cuz I think the hat looks cool it just stays 
there I'm not going to go and take it backstage  
or something so yeah great than you now we have 
one question here in the room hello I'm via from  
nerditude my question is for rans first of all 
congratulations on the win uh we saw how you  
went to give a hug to come when this the game was 
over and he was feeling sad I just want to ask how  
does it feel like going against people I imagine 
you become close or respect as a player and even  
though you win to have the kindness to show them 
support I mean I really respect K because he is a  
great player in my opinion he won Champions before 
and he was like top three this year so like when I  
saw him crying kind of I was sad and I just wanted 
to hug him like like this is just a game you know  
and like beating them doesn't mean that they are 
enemies you know like very still friends so I'm  
just being like kind you know so yeah that's 
oh thank you so much um next question is from
Andes hi my name is andr from BR Sports uh 
good evening congratulation on the winter  
you did pretty well and I have a question for 
Neo I would like to ask you if you have any  
message for old in conditional fans know as 
alarco that you have who have supported you  
regardless of the Rival and now are happy because 
you're in the final yeah um thank you to all the  
fans who have stuck by us even through offseason 
there wasn't uh yeah thank you to all the fans  
that have stuck by us for all the tough times 
and you know the new fans that we've gained  
as well are equally important especially here 
in Asia there's been like an insane amount um  
but yeah it's super nice to have 
a really strong fan base behind us  
you know so yeah thank you to the ones who 
have supported us through everything um to  
the ones who didn't unlucky thank you 
now we have the last two questions uh
ped I heard that song uh it's following me 
everywhere so really do appreciate that um  
I want to ask two questions I'll ask the first one 
right here um piggybacking off of the the last one  
before me just sort of talking about the support 
that you guys have been have obviously it's been  
growing uh for each round that you guys have been 
playing in and winning in you know of course you  
know we've seen people like the greff the co-owner 
of the team you know live streaming himself  
watching you guys play we've seen obviously other 
members within uh this team either in in the  
past and even in the present mixwell also another 
example examp Le of that I mean how does that how  
does receiving that kind of support help you guys 
kind of move forward and just um uh play well and  
just uh make that make this run uh possible and 
I ask this to anyone that would like to answer I  
can uh I mean obviously we all love the support 
um it's super cool having I mean mix for under  
the graph both here um but I mean I think for 
me and maybe I'm speaking for others but like  
when we're in the game or on stage or we're 
preparing for the game we're not really thinking  
about like other people we're focusing just on 
ourselves and the team like if you think about how  
many people you have supporting you and kind of 
the outside stuff then you're not going to focus  
on what's important on you know winning so um yeah 
obviously it's super cool and we love it but you  
know we're going to do our job yeah we are just 
10 people in the game like when we want to play  
official and we want to be be ourselves we need to 
just focus on our 10 people PCH Nicholas Brandon
Weber
thanks right right uh I'll ask my second question 
it's a little bit of a of a long one but bear with  
me please um obviously uh as as has been covered 
so many many times in this press conference and  
even past press conference and even in Prior 
press conference before in Masters and the like  
obviously everybody knows about how you guys 
have been kind of working together to improve  
to reach this point but I kind of want to ask 
individually uh on just your story individual  
story in this making here obviously Neo Zeno you 
dab a little bit it in CS and other games and in  
in conjunction with Weber dabbled a little bit uh 
in dark zero and na dark ratio I I remember that  
a shout out for the for the na people um Benji 
fortnite everyone knows the story about that Buu  
mini Buu uh initially started your careers um uh 
uh in different teams now you guys are united um  
Reen woot starting out in Turkey making the names 
for yourselves and uh playing well continuing to  
play well reaching this point all as a unit and 
that said as you guys now look ahead towards  
this final step on which I might say uh I might be 
wrong but the biggest game of your lives um that  
said um should you guys win tomorrow what would 
winning this this Championship mean for you and  
and everyone else within the team and I ask this 
to anyone that everyone for to answer if you guys  
would like I I can start like tomorrow is just 
another game like if when you start bringing up  
the meaning to the game mod it's really important 
every game is important that we play and tomorrow  
is going to be the same like every usual day 
we're going to play official and we're going  
to prepare for the official the same way and uh 
the meaning of it uh we'll have enough time like  
five months and offseason to create the meaning 
of it if you're going to win you know but for now  
it's just every other game tomorrow and it's 
it yeah I agree uh it might sound boring but  
yeah it's just another game because yeah if you 
start putting stuff to the game then I don't know  
there's pressure there is I don't know like it's 
just not worth it it doesn't matter at the end  
and yeah and for me the meaning is like already 
what we achieved just means that whatever we did  
was right so it's just like a proof that the way 
the way we think the way we work was right which  
is nice yeah you go you go yeah you go okay uh I 
mean for me the way I like to think is like all  
emotions are temporary um whether you win whether 
you lose you're going to feel the same eventually  
like after so you know you just got to live in 
the present and not think too much by the occasion  
like in the end it doesn't it doesn't matter 
um obviously it's cool but it doesn't matter  
for me I was dreaming about this moment before 
three years but I made that mistake one time  
in shangai shangai finals now P Tomy said this 
another game day we will focus no matter what and  
we will just feel like in home and playing prag 
together yep and I want to say one thing that uh  
every player in our team have their reasons to 
win and one of my reason to win is my teammates  
of course because we worked hard for this moment 
like winning going to make me so happy because all  
my teammates won as well you know like not only 
because of me so like tomorrow hopefully we will  
win as a team and everyone will be happy yeah I 
mean I think what all the guys are said is a good  
way to sum up right like again for me I just want 
us to play good boring valerant like like me and  
Weber always preach and yeah it is literally just 
another official with a k a k poop concert before  
it it's just it's just a fun official yeah we're 
chilling I want to watch that yeah no PR today  
sry tomorrow I mean before official Weber said 
I want to see the opening ceremony tomorrow so  
we just won yeah that's true for Weber you 
know thank much and the question is from s
again um my question goes to mini boo boot or 
Rin any of you can answer it um last year you  
know all of you are playing in Challengers and 
now you are one match away from being Global  
Champions what do you think of your time spent 
in Challengers as a path to Pro and how did it  
prepare you for competing and succeeding in 
VCT on team Heretics I think it's completely  
different because uh like vcls like Challenger 
leagues are working completely different from uh  
EMA and partner Leakes for example you can't 
like you can't read enemies games like you  
need all you need to do just play randomly 
because it's it's it's completely different
overall I mean I agree that it's uh different 
and I think when you're playing in vs you don't  
really know how good you are like there is 
no scale you know and there is like way more  
like question marks you haven't like yet proven 
yourselves and yeah like I don't know it's just  
different like it's hard to compare it and it's 
like yeah I mean playing in tier one is always  
better than in tier two I mean I have different 
opinion on that because like when I was playing  
in Turkish League like Turkish League is kind of 
like full W you know like like a ape ranked kind  
of so that prepares you that U your enemies in 
in international tournaments because you would  
never know what is papx going to do in a official 
like I'm not going to lie you I would never know  
what are they going to do like so playing in 
Turkish League let's say that prepares me to  
paperex you know like I mean we didn't beat them 
but you know some some kind of Chinese teams as  
well like their game play is kind of different 
that like they're good they will never forgive  
you if you like um make mistakes of course but 
they're like so Random you know so playing in  
Challengers League before kind of prepares you 
for the all the situations because as wood said  
you don't know what is your enemy going to do like 
you cannot kind of read them so yeah it's also I  
want to add one more point I think the Challenger 
leags are really good step for showing yourself to  
partner teams and yeah it's working like that you 
need to show yourself in Challengers league and  
one partner team going to get you it's working 
like that in I think it was same for everyone  
right like I mean Neil probably looked at us play 
or like they saw us um or NE like they they saw us  
during like us playing in tier two yeah so I mean 
that's how we're here now yeah it's a good system  
to scout players and see how they perform under 
environments and then obviously in officials but  
yeah it's definitely a positive thing thank you 
and good luck and Grand finals tomorrow thank you  
thank you thank you now we have the last question 
in the room uh hello and what do you think you  
guys that will be the result tomorrow and maybe 31 
or 32 and everyone can answer the question thank
you um I mean we always hope for a three- Z I 
think I mean we always play for a three- Z but  
obviously I mean they're also a good team like 
we can also lose rounds like dumb rounds they  
they can lose dumb rounds like I don't know when 
when it's at this level you can't really predict  
it but I mean we always for me I always go for 
a 13-0 uh so I'm hoping for three 13 zeros and  
a 3 that would make me very happy I mean I 
think we're going to win tomorrow the score
yeah okay thank you so much uh 
thank you totic for joining us  
today uh and for sharing your talks 
and experience thank you thank you
