hello everyone uh again congratulations for your 
Victory uh fanatic so we are going to open the  
floor for some question from the media uh Alan 
yeah is it me yep oh okay thank you hi boster  
it's Alan can you hear me yeah hi nice classes by 
the way uh so um you have been into top eight and  
uh you are going to face another you know uh 
one of the three teams Heretics and uh maybe  
Trac sports or G2 are there any specific one 
of one of them you want to meet in the first  
round of your top eight uh if I was to choose 
it would be G2 uh the reason why is because  
uh throughout the whole entire existence of uh 
Valen I don't think I've ever played them and I  
think it would be a fun match and yeah i' I've 
seen events ever since one of the icelands but  
I've never played them yet and I think that 
will be a that's a match I want to I want to  
I want to beat okay thank you good luck thank 
you thank you so much uh next question is from
Pedro hey guys ped Romero here um congrats on the 
victory to everyone uh within the team I got a  
question for um durka obviously you played very 
well um performing as the best player within the  
team in my opinion of of course if if you that's 
wrong please uh uh correct me on that but still  
just asking about your performance um what do you 
think just went white for you to just continue to  
play well you know despite the shaky uh first 
map uh from that point going forward all the  
way to the very end uh I mean sunet was never 
a good map for me I think and uh it went a bit  
Shak for me but I was like just like trying to 
come help out others and I kind of felt like we  
could have won even though we were like down 
so much but also I was like can't really get  
tilted if I'm having a bad game or something so 
I was like U you know like after we lost Sunset  
I was like we have Haven and Lotus now it's like 
prob my best team maps that I like really like  
playing so I was just confident in them so I guess 
like just uh playing well in those uh last team  
uh like I think it benefited from me not 
getting tilted or like frustrated from like  
the stress or whatever uh in the first 
map like when I was going down like 15
17 oh uh we have another question for
Pedro right uh I'm going to send this one over to 
to Boler uh a little bit of a piggyback on on my  
last question but more so just focusing on just 
everyone with the team obviously uh despite the  
the shaky start to the series there were moments 
in which everyone popped off individually speaking  
not just derka I'm sure I remember that 
back then there was a clutch made by Hero  
and then also yourself playing on the operator 
popping off on that as well and so it just sort  
of gives out a very uh uh Collective effort 
and so when you see a team like that playing  
well in which everybody else has their moments 
besides you know yourself or or der durka how  
important does that that bring to the form of 
the team you know going forward into the future  
as you guys now head towards playoffs both you 
know physically and also mentally as well yeah  
something I was saying in the hudle before the 
first game is that each one of these players  
they know how to win um and that's like with us 
whether it be lock in or Tokyo and for hero am  
um we know how to win we know what we're 
capable of when we're feeling ourselves and  
I think honestly with our team because everyone 
is so good you don't need uh one person popping  
off consistently it's like you can almost take 
it in turns and I think that's the trust you  
need in your teammates to know that okay all 
right Derk is going to carry me on this Lotus  
all I need to do is do my job and be consistent 
and not try too hard if I'm not having the best  
success and just try to make his life as easy 
as possible and it goes with all the other Maps  
as well Chronicle had a beast of a sunset at the 
start like really bought us some rounds back and  
gave us a lifeline on defense um and yeah like 
you said a hero on Haven as well I can remember
specifically Alia yeah Good Vibes no 
um no he did a little fortnite dance  
he must have done something good that 
round no I can I can find something  
wait let me think Avia when he goes 
left in the iso it looked not bad  
um but no like even Alia in in our game versus 
DRX he he he performed so well and he was like  
popping off in all cylinders so it's like like 
it's just like everyone has capability everyone  
has potential it's just we just got to trust 
each other and and keep the Vibes positive  
because if we can stay positive and we can stay 
good mood and good coms then that allows for  
someone else to thrive who might not Thrive if 
we were to go all negative and start being quiet
so much and next question is from
fako hey guys can you hear me yes well my 
question is for chronicle uh but it's going  
to be two questions uh first of all uh looking 
back on 2021 won when when you won Champions uh  
yeah the you were the the last The Last Enemy of 
crew dreams in in that Champions and nowadays you  
you have again the you made it again the the crew 
biggest enemy H how do you feel about being the  
the lock down of the of the dreams of 
crew and my second question is about the  
the match but then I ask you so okay the 
first question sadly I didn't win Champs  
but I won against crew I understand it and 
uh yeah it's obviously like I felt about  
this much the same like just coming to the 
first map I have to [ __ ] this I I have to  
redo my 5K a against them sadly it didn't happen 
but it was very very close at some point in on  
Sunset uh even twice but I mean I'm happy with 
that I'm won again against them again and uh  
I can't I can't be asked about it and uh about 
the match overall I think besid a very shaky uh  
stress got over us at some point and we but like 
we were not warmed up but after that we started to  
do some good stuff especially on T side of sunset 
even though we lost it we did well and we didn't  
let us fall down really hard uh after losing the 
map and we just transferred all our performance  
uh from map one to map two and three and I'm 
really happy with D Performance also just because  
he popped off today he justed them on the second 
third map and uh it's obviously very good so yeah
thank you so much uh we have another question from
pero I want to send this one over to to the 
coach um just sort of asking about your point  
of view on first map and just kind of what what 
was the biggest difficulty that faced the team um  
especially in the first half where you guys were 
put in the deficit on the defending side and sure  
you guys were able to to make that comeback um 
in the second half obviously uh it didn't result  
in the victory but still um biggest um issues 
that you saw um in that first map I think we're  
a little bit passive and we didn't need to be 
I think there's a lot of scenarios where we had  
the information and we could have rotated and 
and held the site but we just kind of played a  
bit off site and forced ourselves into retakes 
which we we couldn't really win so I think that  
was the that was early on on the half and then 
I think we won a couple of rounds and CW out a  
couple of big ones um and then after that I me we 
had a 3v1 that we just we need to be winning that  
but we just couldn't so I think a lot of it was 
just just having different options in our game I  
think we kind of just a bit too passive I think 
we could have taken the fight to them a little  
bit more actually on the sites um but I think that 
was the main thing just a few things to clean up
overall all right uh I want to ask one more 
question again over to Boer um before the  
start of the competition I asked you um about your 
expectations for this event um as you're gearing  
up for set event and you said that basically it 
was zero so I want to ask I I want to have a a  
little bit of a of a heat check right now as you 
guys head over to playoffs is it still zero are  
are the expectations still at the absolute bare 
minimum or has there been any change within that  
regard yeah for me I don't like expectations 
I'm not expecting anything um I'm just kind of  
going with the flow and going with the Vibes uh 
but yeah I believe like I wouldn't be here if I  
didn't think that we could win this event and 
and like do well so I believe in the players  
I have in front of me and I believe of what they 
are capable of and how sick at the game they are  
and we just got to they just got to believe 
in themselves ain't that right um yeah like  
they have there's so much potential in this team 
um and in these individuals that like yeah like  
who as an igl beat up you know who wouldn't be 
chilling right now no I'm not chilling that's  
for sure but uh yeah uh no expectations 
but I believe I'm believing believe to
achieve oh oh thank you so much 
uh once again uh congratulations  
fanatic uh we expect to see more 
from you in the future so thank
you go
