thank you so much uh we'll go next to 
Sons of Kos hello everyone thanks for  
the opportunity to ask a question uh my 
question is for casnet I want to ask if  
it's okay to do it in Spanish 
goad yes it is okay I'm here k
perfect thank you very much good luck in 
the coming matches the question was about  
uh an objective for crew um especially as a 
team and second question would be to rank the  
Duelists uh where would kzn put himself and kzn 
responded that uh one of crew's objectives is  
to obviously pass groups and in rankings he 
would put himself and then Asus and nobody
else all right we'll go next to Brandon at
exports. awesome thank you very much I'll ask 
this to Boer um with the Olympics going on right  
now um I'd like to ask kind of your thoughts 
on on Regional pride in valerant you know are  
you playing for your team you know do you have 
a sense of playing for you know Amia and you  
know which uh country do you think would perform 
best in in a sort of valerant Olympics okay so if  
there was a a valerant Olympics well I think 
it's safe to say UK is not going to be doing  
very well there uh no maybe we do okay we we' be 
believing that's for sure um I think the obvious  
one is turkey uh South Korea like those ones I've 
already got teams that are performing pretty well  
as a core fivan roster um but yeah as for this 
event if I'm playing for EMA or anything not  
really I'm just I'm just here to play the game 
and have fun at champ so let's let's let's get
it thank you we'll go next to OnePlus
uh stage
today can I for
[Music]
uh there is two question the first question 
is actually in previous time there is lots  
of ups and downs in blg and I just want to 
know especially like there is lot there is  
two players like nav and flexing they are the 
debut on the International Tournament so do  
you think uh there is a little bit Intense 
or how do you guys manage to adjust your  
mentality and uh his answer is I don't think 
we should do many adjustment of our mentality  
because we are super like relaxed or something 
stuff like that and talk about nap and flexing  
actually do you used to play other type of 
uh games or other tournament in the previous  
time so and also I told nav that I will take 
him to uh take his first win and the second  
question is uh blg haven't played a b this 
new map in playoffs or stage two so will  
you play it in Champs and uh night's answer 
is if I have the opportunity maybe I will
thank you so
much uh we'll take the next question from Sierra 
yeah hello um my question goes to Boer I just  
wanted to ask um for comments on your upcoming 
collaboration with derivat uh for Champions just  
how was it experienced what was like a favorite 
memory with preparing that song that's coming out  
on August 2nd yeah I think uh der cat's pretty 
good at making music safe to say uh whenever I  
had any like ideas or if I was to say anything 
she'd quickly be able to efficiently work on it  
and then give me some feedback or send it back 
to me uh I didn't actually get to spend too much  
time on it we had one little Discord call for 
like three hours and uh that was when I wrote  
the rap uh but yeah she she did really good in 
the song uh the boys listened to it and they  
were like yeah she sounds really good me on 
the other hand we're not really sure how good  
I am in it so I'm not going to say anything I'll 
just let everyone else interpret however they want  
to feel about it uh but yeah I don't know if 
I'm excited or a bit like oh no with that is  
coming out but we'll see it was a fun it was a fun 
little project um and I'm always happy to uh do  
these sort of things and yeah I mean you'll have 
to wait and see uh what day is it 2nd of August  
2nd of August thank you no worries I assume we're 
not getting a preview on this press conference  
uh uh no I'm afraid I forgotten it all right uh 
we'll go next to Ravish uh sorry hey what's going  
on everybody uh so question again to follow up 
with Boer as well too uh so real quick as always  
uh what what dances have you prepped for your 
walkout so far are there anything we can look  
forward to and just real quick on the second I 
saw on I saw on will minder's list you put the  
you also put Kiss of Life on there so what was 
your bias on that band yeah that's it um yeah so  
walkouts I haven't actually prepared any walkouts 
yet I I won't lie because every time I prepare to  
walk out it's very difficult to do them when 
we walk out because it's like we're walking  
on stage I don't know where the cameras are so 
it's really difficult to know when to actually  
dance so it's been quite difficult um so this 
event we potentially have some celebrations so  
so that might be exciting that if if they all 
get allowed and um yeah I I think I'll prepare  
I'll save the walkouts for uh if we make it 
to the the big Stadium because I think I know  
how the the camera angles will work there and 
it'll be easier to pull off I think um so yeah  
so there that and then yeah so obviously Kiss of 
Life have been involved in the Champions Anthem  
and I was like oh who are they I kind of so like 
some like Tik toks about them but I never listened  
to their music so then I started listening to 
their music just in case I was to meet them at  
this event and be like oh hey y what's up like 
oh I listened to this song I like this song uh  
which it uh so yeah so that was that was my 
planning for that conversation and honestly I  
don't really have a a a stand right now because I 
don't actually know them so we'll see on the day  
if we do end up getting to meet them whoever 
kind of well I'm only meeting two I guess so  
either Julie or Natty is going to be the one 
that's could be the bias to be fair so uh there  
we go Sol thanks man cheers no worries thank 
you we'll go next to Miguel Mendes from codigo
Esports hello hello yes [Music]
the question was what aspect has crew 
been working on since their elimination  
in BCT Americas and KET said he's been 
working on his mental and how to really  
close out games but they haven't really 
had much time to work on anything else  
thank you we'll take the next question from Alan 
okay thank you so this is a question for kite uh  
the first of all his IDE is pronounced as kight 
is not Knight yeah good uh so my question is uh  
for kight and uh my question is you know it's 
been a year since your last appearance in the  
international stage and the last year's Champion 
is Miracle wrong and it's uh something that will  
go in the books in the history books of VCT but 
uh compared to last year what do you think you  
have been uh most growing up your take away from 
the whole years's G you know this process so can
okay so the the answer from sk9 is uh actually 
this is not easy year for them so it's very  
bumpy and uh they have new coach coming in 
and uh their philosophy has uh a little bit  
switching up and uh they think that uh the 
most important part is their improvements  
in mentality and uh uh yes that's all thank you 
thank you we'll take the next question from Tong
dang hi this question is for bosta uh congrats 
on winning the stage two Trophy and you guys are  
going to playing against uh blg in your first 
match and they beat nrgy twice in 2023 chance  
after not being expected to do so so uh do you 
guys have any expectation for this match um truth  
be told I I don't think I have any expectations 
uh we're just going to prepare uh like we have  
to any team uh because anything can happen at an 
event so we're not going to let our guard down and  
we know I think we're just going to take it very 
like chill for me this event I'm going to just be  
very chill because when I'm chill we're actually 
playing quite well so I think that's going to be  
my focus and as for the team we're just going to 
prepare hard and take it game by game so yeah we  
got Billy Billy first we played them in the past 
so it' be a nice little rematch for them uh and  
yeah I'm I had my life game versus them last time 
and I'm not going to lie we played Deathmatch  
versus each other today and I was shooting some 
heads like uh so maybe I'll be able to uh shoot  
heads on the game day as well uh so yeah I mean 
I'm just super excited to play on the stage and  
uh Shanghai didn't go as as how I expected and so 
this event I I know what went wrong and I know uh  
what I did uh what I could have done better and 
this event is going to be a Redemption for that
hopefully thank you uh we'll go next to Quang 
valerent Tang dang uh hello uh I have a two  
question for two player first of all is Boer uh 
uh coming to Champion with a new player hero still  
like experiment in international competition how 
do you feel about this player after BCT EMA statu  
you can answer for and we can go to player two 
okay um yeah so yeah we've got hero it's his first  
International Tournament but it was his first game 
against BBL and he played pretty well back in the  
this this split and I don't think anything's any 
different the guy he's quite stoic in his mindset  
he's a yeah he's just a kid that's enjoying the 
whole gaming process so yeah I think he's going  
to do fine I think we've been we've been doing 
really well uh and in scrims he's been popping  
off on some of the scrims which is what we like 
to see uh we're not expecting it every map but  
when it does happen we got to praise it so yeah 
I think we're we're yeah we're having fun I'd say  
okay thank you uh my second question for cnit 
from crew for uh what do you think about your  
performance in VCT America and a CH about 
your team can go deeper into Champion also  
what about any changing about your team 
performance in this season thank you so
much performance
[Music]
so individually on his performance he performed 
lower than he expected and for the second part  
of the question as a team they really want to 
work on that mental and especially they've had  
very little time they've had to prep for four 
days so they're going into it hopeful but also
anxious thank you we'll take the 
next question from Valeria hello  
everyone and welcome to Soul my question 
is to DRX MCO at the end of stage two and  
especially in playoffs you guys demonstrated 
an impressive play and unbelievable progress  
as a team what enabled such a quick growth 
and uh do you think that you can keep the  
momentum and get even better throughout 
the Champions and additionally do you  
think that your younger teammates uh will 
handle the pressure of international games
well can you repeat the question please please 
uh sure uh the question was what enabled such  
a quick growth for the team throughout the 
playoffs and do they um are they able to keep  
the momentum for the Champions and additionally 
about the younger teammates if they can handle  
the pressure of international games well 
in marus um opinion thank you thank you
ch
champion
well uh during stage two we were you know open to 
talk about any sort of mistakes and also we were  
open to having those hard talks to make sure that 
we fix uh our mistakes and also clean up our game  
and I think we have a good momentum going forward 
also we have young players who can shoot so I  
think we're going to perform better than we did 
in stage two as well in terms of the experience  
uh that the younger players need because for some 
of them this is their first International Event  
um ever I'm trying to provide them 
with the best guidance that I can  
to make sure that they perform 
well under the pressure thank you
Kam thank you and we'll take the last 
question of this press conference from
Brandon thank you very much I'll ask this to 
kzn it um we've seen crew at uh you know every  
iteration of Champion so far but the team 
hasn't made it out of the group stage since  
2021 uh my question is what makes this team 
different than the the past teams where you  
guys think you can make that deeper run you 
know what kind of improvements have we seen  
over the years you know we saw that lcq run 
last year you guys had that run this year at  
the start of VCT America stage one just 
what makes the team this year different  
compared to those in the past where you 
feel you guys can pull it off finally
ch
he said they can really uh reach a new level here 
because they have a lot of new players um notably  
shy and MCA uh who play really good Lookouts 
and they've helped their play style and you  
know just believing in each other they have that 
chemistry and that potential to do better this
time thank you so much we're actually 
going to keep taking a few questions  
uh I got false cue that we should be 
wrapping up we'll go next to Sky key
this question was about whether Marco feels 
comfortable taking over that igl role now and  
Marco's answer was it's been two months since 
I uh took over the Elling Duty and for me I  
wouldn't say I'm entirely comfortable or used to 
the role but I'm getting better and I'm feeling  
more comfortable but there are still a lot 
of things to learn when it comes to you know  
uh being a better igl so I'm just have to keep 
trying to be you know a better leader for the
team thank you we'll go next to Pedro
Romero guys nice to see you guys over in in 
this press conference we got a question for for  
sir uh you mentioned a little bit about 
expectations for the upcoming match against  
Billy Billy I want to just kind of piggyback 
off that not just focusing on this match but  
just focusing on just your expectations the 
entire year of course you know um youve spoken  
half lengths over uh your mentality and also the 
team's mentality um for throughout this year you  
know not making uh Madrid playing in Shanghai 
going through stage two having hero um getting  
into the team and then continuing the form through 
stage two and making Champions how is that kind  
of mentality of yourself um changed throughout 
this entire year in which you now reach a point  
in where you know now you're getting ready for 
this event and in addition to that how do you  
kind of compare this whole process to last year 
because of course you this is a different Squad  
compared to last year Squad at this point of the 
year um I think that yeah that kind of something  
up with the expectations I think expectations have 
been the bane of me this year starting the year  
expecting this uh going to Shanghai expecting that 
um and I just think like the game doesn't care  
about what I expect or what the team expects the 
game only cares about if you go up on that day and  
you shoot heads essentially so I think coming into 
this event I have zero expectations I uh I'm um uh  
and that's what I'm kind of focusing on I could 
come to this vent and be thinking oh I I want to  
get to here I want to do this I expect this but I 
think it doesn't it doesn't make a healthy boaster  
it makes a boaster that is uh stressed and whiny 
and Aggy and expecting Too Much from the players  
and then they end up uh falling a bit behind 
as well so uh something that I'm going to be  
working on over the next two days is literally not 
living by that rule and whatever happens happens  
and yeah like screw it you know let's just go and 
play some games and see if we shoot heads on the  
day and that's all I'm gonna do and I'm just gonna 
prepare as hard as possible so that we have more  
of a chance of winning but that that's pretty much 
it um and then as for in comparison to this year  
uh uh and like getting hero in I think that's 
a big thing like hero we didn't expect that he  
would be playing and uh and it worked out so I 
think that's the thing you know you just got to  
roll with what your the hand you've been given and 
do your best and everyone seems to be stepping up  
and I'm really liking the progress we've made and 
the the step the journey that we're going to you  
know um yeah I'd say that that that would be it in 
comparison to last year we were a fresh team and  
we were uh hungry this year we were CH juggling 
different challenges and yeah I think it's all a  
big learning experience and I'm very grateful for 
it and grateful to be in this space and playing  
the video game um and doing extra stuff too so 
yeah I think this this tournament you we'll have  
to wait and see how far we go uh but first game 
Billy Billy and uh yeah we'll go from there thank  
you we'll take the next question from stra Sports 
thank you so my question is actually for both  
makco and boster so as makco mentioned he's been 
igl of DRX for a few months now but on the other  
side boster has been igl of fanatic for quite a 
while now so I want to ask the two of you do you  
feel any differently about this responsibility uh 
from when you first stepped up as IG compared to
now for
[Music]
[Music]
well at first uh I had to start from the scratch 
uh I was feeling lost you know what am I supposed  
to do how am I supposed to call those shots 
that uh can help my my teammates and help the  
team but now I'm slowly kind of getting used to 
it and um and I think I'm learning a lot and I'm  
definitely feeling more comfortable with the role 
and uh it's fun um now that I look at it you know  
you have power to control your teammates and also 
manipulate them um and they do as you say so it's  
a fresh uh role for me and it's it's a fun role 
and for me I'd say just that start uh if I was to  
compare it now I was just enjoying the process 
and didn't expect to be here uh now obviously  
fast forward for years later um yeah there's been 
a lot of learning experiences to learn from and  
just when I thought at the start of this year I've 
been through it all I'm ready for anything boom  
this year happens and there was more learning 
experiences so yeah never gets old never gets  
uh boring that's for sure uh it's always you're 
always tired kind of unless you sleep and gym that  
kind of helps a little bit and yeah unfortunately 
for ma it doesn't get any better from here mate  
so like welcome to the igl in roll uh yeah it's 
tough and it is rewarding though I'll take that
though all right I think you accepted 
his faith yeah all right thank you to  
you both and all the best to 
all of you for your upcoming  
matches thank you we'll take the next 
question from Antonio Romero yes thank
you thev
POS
so the question uh started off you know 
you guys were so close to classifying for  
Shanghai and then it became a bit complicated 
and you guys almost didn't reach um these  
Internationals how much did uh the match 
against Hunter Thief affect you guys and  
keset responded you know I didn't feel any 
pressure uh neither of the other guys felt  
any pressure you know if we didn't win it we 
just had to work harder and you know we got  
to where we are now because everybody worked 
really hard and it's become like this positive
change thank you um and we'll 
take the last question from
arnab hey guys first of all uh I want 
to ask actually to all of you guys uh  
I'm interested to know what are your 
PMS for Champions uh in in the ingame  
feature which is recently introduced by 
R and what are your simple thoughts on
it sorry did you say the thoughts on the new map 
Abyss no no no no uh the new champs pick uh event  
which is being introduced and what are their PS 
uh I expect bias from everyone but uh it would be  
great to know about their thoughts the Champs 
picks yep okay so the the Champs Pickins are  
essentially something where the community can 
vote and choose who wins against who and then  
if you get 100% you get a title for me I've never 
done a picks in my life so like it doesn't affect  
me but it is quite fun for the community I can see 
how it can be quite exciting especially if uh you  
are on route to 100% but good luck if anyone gets 
100% I'll save my head no I won't really but yeah
he says he doesn't know what to think about that 
it's kind of a bad question is there any other  
maybe question you'd like to ask yeah we we'll 
take another one yep um strafe would you like to  
close us out with your question sorry no my hand 
was actually raised by mistake I'm so sorry Alan  
we'll go to you then okay so my final question to 
wrap up for you guys uh hi Boer I'm Alan can you  
hear me yeah I can hear Hello so you know that 
in this group like Marco and casnet and you you  
three all experienced 2021 Champions and it's 
it's it's been h of three years and uh looking  
back to this kind of three years time and uh it's 
actually there are a lot of longevity players like  
you and like all three of you and what is your 
at least a personal thoughts about your secrets  
in keeping your longevity in Esports career 
yeah honestly I think the only reason I'm here  
is because I'm an IG let's be real so I've I've 
really focused on that route and it seems to be  
working out whereas when I remember Mao when he 
first joined the guy was literally like a 200 I  
can't remember how many ADR he was but he was like 
he was popping heads at the start at the start of  
DRX and so I'm not surprised that he's still here 
today as long as he is still motivated and yeah I  
still remember kzit running through Haven garage 
jumping in the window and shooting me in the head  
uh and I felt like I couldn't do anything against 
him on the Raina at that champion so yeah I think  
that's why I'm sat here today it feels like just 
yesterday in my opinion like I don't know where  
the time has gone uh but yeah that's why these 
guys are still in the game is because back then  
they were still at the top of the game and they 
were like some of the classified as some of the  
best in their roles um so yeah and that 
and yeah I think I've answered it there  
we go okay thank you thank you and good luck to 
you guys thank you mozet Boer kite thank you so  
much for taking uh part in this press conference 
and we'll be back with the final Group after this
