we'll begin with the remote media and then move 
to the in-house questions stra Fe Sports you can  
have the first question hello thank you um first 
of all commiserations in the L guys um despite the  
end result not being um in your favor I wanted to 
get your initial thoughts on how you feel having  
made it this deep into Shanghai and your overall 
thoughts on the run as a whole this question yeah  
I can take it uh for me like I couldn't be any 
prouder of the boys like obviously we literally  
just finished 10 or 15 minutes ago so it's quite 
the emotions are still quite raw um but honestly  
like we came into this tournament to have some 
fun and gain experience and you know it's going  
to hurt right now but when they look back on it 
in an hour two hours tomorrow what has had like  
the most insane debut you can possibly have on 
jist off roll played incredible um you know Buu  
like like developed so much as an igl like inis RS 
you guys can see 100% one of the best initiators  
in the world as well um Benji also incredible and 
I can't even begin to speak about Patty Tech like  
this guy is just insane so I am just so happy 
that they got to show a chance or get a chance  
to show how good they were you know and as for 
the final itself um yeah honestly I think it  
the two map banss and just a best of five uh 
without playing maps that we kind of spammed  
during this tournament like Sunset bind it came 
back to bite us and we lost to an incredible team  
like welld deserved you know there was we got 
completely outplayed in the last on the last  
two maps so yeah there's no uh there's nothing 
else I can say really just we lost to the better  
team and that's what it was thank you can I ask 
a follow-up question go ahead course uh thank you  
um again this question goes to any one of you 
guys um throughout your entire run at Shanghai  
do you have a a standout moment a favorite 
moment from the tournament that you has had  
that You' like to recount um I can also you want 
you want answer no I say you were going to speak  
go um I think for most of us it's the fbx game 
where we could have been out and not even make  
playoffs but at 11 12 round and like the overtime 
defense rounds from what like that game was crazy  
and yeah like it got us to playoffs and we 
snowballed from there so I mean obviously we  
played a lot of great games but that was kind 
of the turning point for the tournament for me
personally yeah I'd agree as well from 
a coaching's point of view like fpx were  
one of the teams that surprised me the 
most and it kind of reminds me of us  
at Madrid we lost to Sentinels and papx 
like very very close games um and fpx I  
think did the exact same thing right they 
lost to to Oz and jeni so yeah fpx were
incredible thank you we'll go to sports Keo next 
uh yes uh first of all commiserations on the loss  
guys my question is for paritech so since this 
is most likely the last time you'll be playing  
with this version of the Heretics roster I wanted 
to know how your experience has been playing with  
them and if there are any words you'd like to sort 
of send them off with with for the future matches  
yes uh first of all I would like to thank 
you Neil and everyone in this team uh bo  
wood ANS pji mini Bo at home um these guys are 
incredible and for sure they will go I mean I'm  
100% confident they will win Champions um so yeah 
and for me personally I was tring this tournament  
as a as a way to show off myself because in 
mad I couldn't do that I think it's because  
was my like First International Event and 
I was kind of stressed and couldn't really  
adapt to the stage but in this tournament it was 
a completely different story and I think I proved  
many people wrong hopefully at least and yeah I 
mean nothing but love for guys at Team Heretics  
like um what they are doing and what they've 
built so far is I think like one of the best  
teams in the world and they're going to prove 
it on Champions and in future as well like as  
said like 10 minutes ago in the hard room like 
this is the beginning and the future is bright for
them thank you I think we have 
some questions from the in-house  
media yes has oh you didn't play B brid 
before at all but you have to play it  
today so what's your plan for this map 
anyone can answer the question thanks
I mean we kind of pray that it will work uh 
yeah the brieze like we didn't play it we  
scrimmed it a bit we prepared for EDG I think 
because we kind of expected to play it uh we  
played like two scrims on it I think and after 
the preparation for we didn't touch the map at  
all so now when we came like obviously we looked 
at our Bri yesterday we saw some stuff like we  
noted some stuff but I think the inexperience 
the map on the comp on I don't know on the map  
itself like they're just better like we had no 
idea what to do we didn't know like what's the  
goal on the rounds we didn't know like how to 
make micros to get entries and so on well they  
knew like they're comfortable like you could 
see obviously I think so yeah I mean we knew  
that it's their pick like it's not end of the 
world if you lose it and I think like we won  
the next two uh I think it was not about about 
Breeze today it was about lotos and split um
so thank you are there any more 
questions from the in-house
media this question is for what you have 
already done your decent job and let the  
world remember your name and a little bit 
commiseration on today's Grand Final but I  
would just want to ask you about the whole 
impression of Master shenhai like it was  
very good tournament and good experience like 
for me also my team we played very well until  
like Grand Final last the map I think we did 
like our best everyone did like their best we  
lost but I think it's fine like we played 
with stunning we just played like for fun  
is but we are still like Grand Final we are 
still in Grand Final we lost but we are still  
in Grand Final like for me like I don't want to 
still like don't want to play dellis that much  
like when Min will come back I will give him his 
roll back I'm sure about it uh that's all from
me thank you we have one more 
question from strafe E Sports  
um hi uh so my question is open to anyone on 
the team so do you think that the double VTO  
that ji had for the maps played some sort of 
an role or it it had some sort of an impact  
for the outcome of this match or do you think 
that it was all down to just the game play no  
I think it definitely it did I mean do you want 
to answer bro 100% yeah like definitely uh like  
I said I think we've had you know every single 
game we've had this tournament we've got better  
and better and better as the tournament went on 
um people that left sunsetting we were already  
very comfortable on that um bind we got really 
really good at after like you know we lost to  
G2 so we literally hadn't played Breeze and we 
hadn't played split in a long time this event  
and again no practice days really to to get it 
we I think we played like three consecutive days  
in a run now so I think it's the fact that you 
don't really get a break um and then you go into  
play against team like gen G who have had a day 
to rest and then they also get to take two bands  
and then they also get to pick the first map like 
it's a big Advantage you know um but that's not  
taking anything away from them like not at all you 
know we had the we had the same pleasure of that  
uh advantage in the M Grand finals um so it's not 
like it's a sure thing you know but geni are just  
a really good team so yeah they took full full 
advantage of it and we couldn't do much about it
thank you uh strafe did you have one more 
question yes thank you so this is the final  
question from my side obviously you guys had a 
great tournament this you had a great tournament  
made it all the way to the Grand finals but 
sadly you couldn't you couldn't win win out  
the final match so my question is for everyone 
here so now that you have a short gap between  
stage two what are your expectations and what are 
your plans going into the next half and also like  
do you have a message that you want to give to 
the at the end of this tournament I think from  
I mean I'll look the guys answerers well but 
from our coach's point of view like we don't  
have much time at all I think there's Visa stuff 
to sort out when we get back uh there's travel  
stuff to sort out when we get back there's you 
know traveling home spending a couple of days  
um with our families and then obviously flying 
back to Berlin so yeah it's we don't have much  
time to prep so we'll have a little debrief 
when we get back to to Berlin and we'll you  
know set some expectations out about what we 
how we're going to approach the first couple  
of games but I mean I'll let the guys answer what 
you said about the fans because for me I think I  
made a tweet about like the experience I've had 
with the Chinese fans has been nothing short of  
like magical from from a cult's perspective so I 
can't imagine what it's like for the players you  
know so it was like living in a dream to be honest 
with the crowd um I've never experienced something  
like this and I don't know if I will experience 
something like this ever again but playing in a  
full Mercedes-Benz arena in Shanghai with like 
with having crowd behind you I mean I think it's  
everyone's dream to like as a player to play like 
in a grand final like that with people behind you  
so yeah love to all the Chinese fans yeah I think 
we all really enjoyed it like the I mean for me  
like the the walk out during Grand finals was 
that's like was really special um and yeah I think  
I think that's something we'll all remember um 
for a long time so yeah know we appreciate all of
them thank you are there 
any more questions for team
Heretics team Heretics thank you so much for  
taking the time to speak with us 
today thank you thank you guys
