we are joined by fanatic who are coming off of 
their match against foot Esports please use the  
zoom hand rais function if you'd like to ask 
a question and then we'll call on you we'll  
begin with sports K yeah uh commiserations on the 
loss guys uh my question is for the head coach so  
this was your first International Event as the 
head coach with this roster I wanted to know  
what your biggest challenges were overall and 
would you say that getting the number one seed  
with the extra days sort of worked against you 
worked against us the problem is just consistency  
from map to map like we look amazing and then 
we look terrible and it doesn't like doesn't  
seem to matter what the map is it can be blus 
to aent to ice box like doesn't really matter  
like it's just just need to find consistency so 
I don't think it worked against us I think we  
had time and could it warmed up and yeah we 
just got to find that consistency I mean we  
won the first map on both Series so We Came Out 
Swinging just couldn't convert the last two maps
thank you we'll go to strafe next uh this 
is for uh the complete team the whole team  
uh also primarily for the coach uh we saw 
a lot of individual struggles during the  
second and third Maps uh people having 
trouble shooting well do you think that  
affected the outcome and do what do you 
think were the more major paining points  
during the second maps in both series that 
you would want to fix before going to split
to I think the I mean on load think we came out 
with the wrong game plan I mean they abuse C  
early on and we were too slow to adapt to that 
we left Al for C they just keep getting Seaside  
over and over again so I don't think you can 
blame the players for that we could have made  
a quicker adjustment thank you uh we'll go next 
to one Esports um hello uh first of all sorry for  
the loss uh this question is for Boer um or the 
coach can answer it as well um despite the loss  
were there any positive moments or highlights 
uh from the matches so far that you'd like to  
share and as the igl or the coach in what ways 
did you see that your team grew during this
tournament well I think I mean the crowd was 
good um I guess we have time now well a day or  
two I don't know when our flight is but I get to 
explore a bit of Shanghai now I guess um that's a  
positive to the rubbish stuff um I don't know like 
we didn't we didn't really get a chance to grow so  
I don't think we we had some nice rounds and some 
nice plays but like we we just we didn't we didn't  
show unfortunate I mean we had good opponents 
but if you want to win you have to beat anyone um  
um yeah sorry I don't I don't know the answer to 
your question apologies it's okay uh thank you so
much thank you are there any questions from the
room ftic thank you so much for 
taking the time to speak with us today
