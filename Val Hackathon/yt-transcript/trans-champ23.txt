I can start again okay okay so welcome everyone uh 
for this press conference uh today we have here uh  
ftic after their match against uh something else 
we now open the floor to question from the media  
uh please raise your hand and I will call on 
you also thank you fnati for being here and  
sharing your thoughts with us uh we are going 
to start with SN uh hi I'm snake from Sports k  
Sports uh my question is for boster so first of 
all commiserations on the loss despite having a  
lot of back and forth in those first few rounds 
of lotus things became very one-sided towards  
the end just wanted to know what according to you 
allowed for that to happen um I don't know Lotus  
defense was a bit of a frustrating one um we we 
got like man advantages on some of those rounds  
especially on the bonus and then I think the 
next round after that we had a nice uh raise  
cooking up as well uh I think the round after so 
it could have gone either way it was just that's  
just valerant I think it just a frustrating game 
to be a part of uh and it can happen you know the  
score line says one thing but our defense I 
think should have been reversed in terms of  
how many rounds we got and how many rounds they 
got uh because we were in the right places uh  
bar two rounds I'd say but yeah it is what it 
is um I'm not going to beat myself up about it  
I already had a a pretty dog event so what I say 
is if someone is having a dog event you're not  
going to win it so uh it come true thank you 
so much thank you so much uh we got more yeah
rabbish guys uh first yeah um tough tough day 
today nationally with a loss uh what I wanted  
to ask uh sorry yeah I'm Rish from na uh I 
want to talk to Hero real quick uh hero man  
um I want to say firstly just I just want to 
do your take on you coming in and talk about  
your experience in this Tournament being this 
like you know you being on the biggest stage  
once more and I find from all perspectives having 
genuinely incredible surprising and also really  
heartful per promises want to want to get your 
take on that um I mean coming here and playing  
and experiencing everything's been really fun 
I would say like everything's been really fun  
but it's just annoying that we can continue it 
I guess I didn't fully hear the question if I  
missed the part oh sorry yeah uh yeah but just 
to go on another uh I just wanted to talk yeah  
just pretty much talk about your experience 
on on being here of the biggest stage and  
like thoughts of your performance because like 
I'll say From perspective I was deeply impressed  
um I mean it's been really fun like the 
experience I think I've showed really good  
sides and a few bad sides and I started off 
Prett good I think when I came into ftic and  
I think I tried doing the same as before but it 
was a little difficult like performing the same
understandable thank you thank 
you uh next question is from
Pedro hey guys Pedro Romero um fortunate that 
the series end the season ended in this way  
but as poster said you know as just valerant 
you just got to go deal with it and move on um  
that it poster this question goes to you um this 
series was a very back and forth Affair in which  
one half one team was dominating the other half 
the team and the other team would be dominating  
and then that kind of pattern carried over in the 
other two ensuing Maps um when you're when you're  
competing in in a match like that how much does 
that kind of affect the team's mentor and just um  
uh and performance you know because on one hand 
on a given moment you guys are very doing pretty  
well and then as I said the other moment I mean 
it feels like the world is kind of crashing down  
so how do you kind of of handled that aspect um I 
think it's just um I guess it's a game where you  
like challenge yourself to the fullest you know um 
both mentally physically and in the game I guess  
um so that game yeah it was very close the rounds 
were super close they could have gone either way  
um and I just think sometimes they won't go your 
way um but I think in general in the game we we we  
we were getting stressed obviously it's that's 
a no-brainer but I think we were managing it  
better than the Heretics game or the DRX game 
so we did grow this event it was just a shame  
that um the the rounds didn't go our way today uh 
I think Sunset was like more frustrating uh in my  
opinion on our defense I think we we were a bit 
too slow on the pedal with our kind of reactions  
and uh they just punished us and then the retakes 
we just we haven't played that m very much to be  
fair so our retakes were uh uncomfortable to 
say the least and yeah I think Sentinels did  
a really good job abusing uh the the the changes 
on the sites and stuff and yeah I mean that's it  
really it's just stressful to be fair I'm just 
I'm not going to lie I'm happy it's over now  
cuz like I I can finally sleep for like a good 
night's sleep at least maybe maybe not tonight  
but like couple of days time I'll be able to 
sleep until I watch the Champs finals again  
then I'll be sad again for a couple of days but 
uh yeah it is what it is I just got a split in  
headache right now I'm just so tired oh so much 
uh we have one question here uh Hey guys zelus  
from Sentinels the winning team um again really 
sorry about the loss and glad you guys are doing  
this press media I just have a question for Boer 
um I I want to know your thoughts when you guys  
won bind and zelus had five kills um what what 
was going through your head going into third  
map or you know even before then honestly I 
didn't know how many kills you had I I swear  
down I I don't look at the frags cuz I know I'm 
going to be on that leaderboard so I just don't  
look at it and I just go next M um but you had 
five kills and bind that's why we won then I'm  
J again thank you I love you guys thank you thank 
you uh next question is from Ria uh hey everyone  
this is strawber from Jinx my question is for 
poster you guys had a rough start this season  
and the team also went through some health issues 
um then hero came in and performed fantastic and  
you guys still made it this far after all the 
challenges that you faced yes sadly you didn't  
go further AR micans but I want to ask you how 
would you sum up this whole VCT 2024 season for
fanatic well at the start of the year we were 
we were thinking yeah we can probably do quite  
well this year maybe try and win one event event 
but I think that's the um that's the privilege  
that we have you know um where we feel like we 
can actually go to these events and be a top  
Contender so to go this year bomb out and kickoff 
go through kind of like a mental challenge for us  
and then go into Shanghai and then H not get 
any wins there I think like this year has just  
been a bit of a roller coaster emotionally 
and uh something that has like bonded us  
more but at the same time it's probably uh 
changed everyone's uh Viewpoint of the game  
in terms of how they might view it uh in 
comparison to last year because last year  
we hadn't won anything uh this year we had won 
stuff and no one likes losing so I think after  
the losses that we've had this year um it's just 
it's just brutal um that's why I know that like I  
like the game but I also just don't like the game 
you know so it's just that's kind of how it is um  
it would be nice if we won but at the same time 
you yeah you can't really control it so yeah I  
don't know what I'm even saying anymore my brain 
is in uh the goo lag get a good rest after you  
go back home good luck for the next season as 
well yes you and we have another question from
P I'd like to ask this to um the people that 
haven't uh spoken so far and conference um  
just of Dera coach Chronicle Alpha year how you 
kind of look back on the season overall now that  
um it's done and yes I do ask this to you guys 
after coming off to this loss but still you know  
any highlights that you kind of will kind of look 
back on um from now until the start of next year  
I mean I can see I think overall looking at the 
results that will beit disappointing Year from us  
just because obviously our goals were winning 
and we didn't really do that at the same time  
I think we had a lot of improvement in terms 
how we play people started to respect us and  
uh people started to see that we we're bringing 
Variety in comps we're bringing Variety in game  
play we started to be not uh as individuals 
like who's everyone strong and can be just  
one versus five sometimes but also as a team 
who will not give any chance if they can like  
uh picking together playing together and we 
were more as a team than this year rather  
rather than previous one and I think we played 
it better but obviously other teams started to  
play much better than previous year so that's why 
we struggle but yeah this one is I think the main
highlight uh some words for the 
other members of the team about that
question I mean it was definitely a very up and 
down yeah I think obviously we started with very  
high expectations um with the team and obviously 
how they performed last year and it was we quickly  
didn't qualify for Madrid and then we got through 
to Shanghai I mean we kind of we just hit that  
peak in split one and just we won that and then 
Shanghai didn't go to plan and then obviously we  
had health health problems but I mean I think one 
one thing that like when we lost a player like Leo  
like you kind of like oh crap like how how's this 
going to get any more difficult but I do think  
that like just the fact that we got here and that 
we just started winning everything was just like  
just crazy like it was just like wow like how is 
how has this happened um where we've basically  
again like it's just like we've just lost like 
one of the best players in the world but to have  
him Step Up um and join the rest of the boys and 
just like have us win all those games and come to  
Champs and and make top six I think is something 
I'll remember was definitely highlight for me um  
obviously you're a bit like upset now and annoyed 
that we lost and stuff like that but we definitely  
have done better we definitely could have gone 
further in the tournament but there was also  
a lot of a lot of upsides along the way it was 
definitely a roller coaster as I think Jake said
earlier so yeah I don't have more 
question we have some question here in the
room okay uh so thank you fanatic 
for being part of Champions uh  
uh your determination sportmanship are 
commendable died his hair thank you thank you
