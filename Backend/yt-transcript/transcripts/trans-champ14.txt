okay uh welcome back everyone uh for the next 
segment we have here Sentinel congratulations  
for your Victory uh so and thank you for being 
here uh now we open the floor to question from  
the media so we are going to start with snck 
r Sports together yes thank you first of all  
congratulations on the win guys my question 
is for John QT so I want to talk about Sunset  
because despite the 66 score line on the first 
STP it looked like your team had more control  
of the map so what would you say allowed DRX 
to make things that close in the second half  
that led to overtime uh I think yeah we had 
a good start of the attack half and we were  
up like 117 116 something like that but they 
did like some good adjustments uh they played  
to flood and was like very smart of them they 
kind of like uh had a good read uh we also a  
bit like overheated to be honest and it's been 
happening uh pass Sunset where we have such a  
big lead and we just like kind of like uh give 
it away and go to overtime but we have a lot of  
reps on Sunset since like off season we played 
a lot and uh I feel like we've played all type  
of games where we're down we're up it's kind 
of close and we have a lot of experience on  
it so yeah thank you so much you so much for 
question uh next next question is from cby
hey guys congrats on the win um my question 
is for Kaplan um was the Zea neon and the  
compositions today prepared for the DRX 
match specifically or how different do  
you think the compositions you played 
today will look in subsequent matches  
now that there are kind of vods to go off of 
and it's kind of lost its surprise Factor um  
Zach actually just picks his his agent when 
he locks in and he said he wanted to play  
neanda uh it's not not uh not information I 
would really want to give out mid tournament  
but obviously we play around with different things 
and work on different things and try to keep the  
toolbox big and uh then make you know then we can 
make smarter decisions about what we bring to each
match thank you so much uh next question
if hello congrats on the win guys I'd like to ask 
this question to zelis a bit of a fun one uh you  
keep doing that post with the Champions Trophy 
or whatever yeah keep doing that uh but I also  
want to ask you watch Deadpool is wering 
recently so would you recreate the dance  
if you won Champions that they do in the 
intro which which dance the one Deadpool  
does in the intro at the start of the movie uh 
I would need a a choreography teacher what is  
that choreography choreography teacher but 
um I mean yeah I mean bye bye bye baby you  
know I mean sure I'll I'll dance I'll do it 
if we win champs yeah nice thank you Champs  
I'll actually buy the Deadpool suit myself 
if we win Champs and I'll do it in the suit  
can wait for it all right good luck next game 
thank you thank you uh next question is from
Lucas hello everyone my 
question for Sassi s so Lucas
B for
over
for so much question is from
Romo hey guys uh congrats on the w i got 
a question for K remember you said during  
the press conference after defeating ji that 
you wanted Dr you got DRX you beat DRX that's  
it I want to ask you just sort of what was 
the approach behind just kind of making the  
game plan from G to DRX and in addition to that 
was what was the biggest similarities and slash  
differences when it came to playing against uh 
both of those teams from your point of view yeah  
um obviously coming into every game it's like 
okay there's there's what what do we need to  
fix what do we want to change to surprise the 
team and what do we want to exploit about the  
other team what do we expect them to change what 
do we expect them to not change it's impossible  
question to answer perfectly or fully but we 
tried our best to kind of look at how they've  
approached previous opponents in games and have 
a guess on what they're going to try to do to us  
and basically stay a step ahead in terms of the 
difference between the two teams I think they're  
very similar I think that they both have a pretty 
structured way of playing they don't have like a  
ton of different setups or plays they seem to 
prefer running the same stuff more frequently  
and kind of having protocols and being drilled I'd 
say that my Impressions from watching both teams  
a lot are that DRX are a little more strategically 
diverse but are a bit more probably drilled within  
the strategies they come in with whereas geni 
are a little less strategically diverse they have  
a little less uh spice to throw in but within 
what they do the players are very creative and
unpredictable thank so much next question is from
fundo hey guys congrats for the 
win and my question is going to be
Fort uh looking on on the match of FIA 
and Trace who who do you think you're
facing uh it's hard to say uh tra look like the 
better team this tournament but EDG always has  
the edge over other Chinese teams and I think 
might have a mental Edge too seems like uh no  
teams can be EDG really in China especially 
in playoffs so I'll probably give it to
EDG thank so much uh next question is for rabis 
sweet thanks guys uh again another huge dub  
once more look really good today uh Zach don't 
laugh bro come on uh so uh my question is to TS  
actually uh Tyson uh when we spoke I think it was 
a couple months ago right after Madrid what you  
said was you know you agreed on giving Jordan 
uh uh that a very nice watch because you give  
you win this is yours the rolly when we when I 
when I asked you back then what you said was if  
you win Champs you would get him an AP maybe an 
AP did I say that you did yes wait really yes I  
have the cliff yet you didn't shake hands for 
the Rolex either I did at the airport I don't  
believe you okay wait I have I have many witnesses 
right here many for what shaking hands does anyone  
remember me shaking hands with Tyson you guys 
did shake hands for that one yeah yeah I could  
split the AP with you man could have told me that 
before this press conference I didn't even know he  
said that my bad Jordan told you but now let's 
say you do win now I I consider the discussion  
just now do you still want to follow through on it 
or do you or do you think nah not not not no not
anymore N I give him too much can you get me 
a dog oh a dog or or like a cat like a really  
expensive cat can I get a Main [ __ ] I I want 
like a $10,000 cat I a gift to the the rest of  
the team I get C screw this team dude yeah 
no don't say that I'm homeless wait can you  
buy me a house that's true he's homeless yeah he 
does not have a place to go back to when he gets  
Stella sorry sorry Tyson I didn't mean to do 
that uh but but all right uh makes sense and  
Zach just for you could you hit the kin Gat 
for me real quick bro my go than I just got
chills thank you so much BR uh 
next question is from uh Rael  
hey guys congratulations on the victory 
my question goes to sassy o Sassi okay
for for
perance fore
call for
you were spitting I don't know what you said but  
thank you thanks so much uh 
we have uh one question from
Pedro I'm going to direct this question towards 
second given a little bit of what was said about  
uh you kind of saying okay screw it I'll 
just play Neon I just want to know like  
what exactly made you want want to just do 
that decision you know was The Vibes right  
were you feeling good uh was there something 
that happened within your day that kind of  
made you feel that you wanted to pick neon 
what was going on in your mind uh I mean I  
was just feeling really Filipino today so 
I play the Filipino character but um we've  
had we've had neon in our back pocket for a 
while we have a good amount of prepware and  
uh feeling very confident with her as of 
late so we we used her and it worked out
well so much uh we have another question for onra 
yeah uh my question is for John QT um as the Press  
said Sunset was really really close second half 
and I wanted to ask about a particular round  
in overtime when it was DRX I think leading 1312 
and you were milliseconds away right from losing  
that uh that round that map because of the spray 
through box on a and I was curious because you  
guys look like you were going for a pivot towards 
B and then you backtracked and WI a with less than  
20 seconds left what did the comms look like what 
was the decision to make that 180 back towards
a uh if I remember right it was just like a mid 
round that I made I think I got like inserted the  
elbow and I told the team because we already had 
the Tyson and be main just uh go fake B split look  
what you what you what you can get if you guys can 
go go if you don't just come back to me a and uh  
I mean it worked out we just had the 
had the good rotations and we we knew  
that we'd have enough time it got a bit 
close at the end obviously but I think  
it was still uh a good call and something 
that we didn't show in regulation so they  
got surprising over time you we have 
one last question in the call is from
ravish hi guys uh Hey guys sorry hey I'm back 
again appreciate it uh so real quick last time  
again we talked you guys mentioned that you 
were you were locked in 16 hours a day playing  
the game is that still the case bro some things 
never change we were doing some calculations in  
the room and let's just say that it is Kaplan 
and the Chocolate Factory over at Sentinels  
because we have not apparently we have not had 
a single off day since we've been to Korea so  
we had the meet and GRE and the is a bad person 
that that is that was our that was our off day the  
meet and greet save us save us save us we're just 
kids blink tce hostage we're almost there can you  
see me blink you can see me blink the chocolate's 
almost made Kaplan thoughts on the bad person  
allegations you know I think they're true and I'm 
Kaplan and I think that gotta do what you got to  
do to win okay all serious we love cap and so you 
know there's going to be a troll that takes us out  
of context but we're all in agre yeah we love C I 
only love them if we keep winning okay okay cheers  
thanks guys cheers thank you thank you thank you 
so much uh we have one question here in the room  
hey guys this is Jacob from Capital esports.com 
my question is for the whole team uh you guys do  
a lot of fun poses and sort of celebrations after 
you win rounds I want to ask like as a team if you  
had to pick one is there one in particular that's 
your favorite uh thanks for the question John two
one there it is thank you thank you thank you and 
we have another question here in the room I have  
a question ah hello we have another question 
in the call is fenita yep thank you hello I'm  
fenita from real news and I wanted to ask two 
things first of all I wanted to ask tens about  
who do you feel could be the strong 
strongest oppent during the VCT and
why I think that's a hard question to answer um 
because each team is very different each team  
have their moments where they shine so I don't 
know if I can put an exact um finger on like a  
team that I think is like a definite like like 
super team and is really strong because I think  
all the teams here uh that have made it this 
far into the event they're all pretty strong  
especially on the other side of the 
bracket I know there's a lot of good  
teams over there uh so it is kind of a hard 
question for me to answer and I can't really
specify thank you and my second question 
is for the coach I wanted to ask how do  
you evalate the team's performance so far 
um what do you think that would be key to  
continue improving and keep having during 
the final and the semi-finals yeah I think  
we have had a lot of slumping this year due to 
larger issues with kind of how we show up and  
communicate on game days and we're now three 
matches in a row of communicating incredibly  
well and communicating through our issues holding 
each other accountable talking a lot keeping the  
Vibes High everything like that so uh obviously 
the number one goal is maintaining that but you  
know if we after three games of it I think we 
could start to trust we will maintain that and  
but our energy elsewhere uh it becomes more about 
the details right as these games get closer and we  
play better opponents we just have to make sure 
we're staying prepared strategically and also  
uh you know we can't just stay the same team Al 
tournament we need to stay creative and switching  
up how we do things and cleaning up small habits 
and mistakes just making sure we don't autopilot  
into these games because obviously every team 
is going to be working hard to prepare to beat  
us thank thank you so much so much uh we have one 
question here I actually have two small questions  
I may ask like first of all congrats with the win 
uh my first question is to Z since no one's saying  
I'm saying congrats with the ace thank you how 
did it feel oh great uh probably wasn't like the  
cleanest Ace ever but it's my first one in Champs 
and I think in a International Tournament in  
general so very very happy with it and my second 
question is t uh today I was filming uh sentinel's  
fans and there was one particular fan who was 
very passionate about Tyson and he kept telling  
me what a great player and a person you are and 
then it turned out it's your Uncle Chris oh yeah
okay so um I wanted to ask how much like the 
family support mean to you and probably you  
want to say something to your dear people yeah 
um honestly like family support it's amazing  
it's always nice to have family come out to 
support uh the team during the games uh I do  
think it's pretty important and overall yeah 
just nice um I'm glad my Uncle Chris was able  
to come out here during this time just because 
uh uh just some like sorry let give you a second  
he's a troll and some stuff he says is really 
funny so I'm glad he's here that boy Chris y
okay uh thank you s for being 
here uh sharing your St and  
experience congratulations once again 
for your thank you thank you thank you
