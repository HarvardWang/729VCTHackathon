we are joined by paper Rex we'll start with 
a few presubmit questions first but if you  
have any questions for the team please use a 
zoom hand raise feature first question goes  
to Alex from Sports Esports this is the third 
time you faced off geni this year however this  
time it felt like geni controlled most of the 
series what do you think allowed for that to
happen I mean I think everyone knows 
we're not we're not in the best shape  
we we we have a lot of uh Ro issues right 
now and we're trying to out and a lot of  
like the like we we're papering the 
cracks over you know and the cracks  
are showing pretty much so hopefully 
the next time we play them with have a  
little bit more time and you'll give a better 
showing thank you next question from strafe
Esports hi guys so first of all sorry 
for your loss so on the second map you  
guys started off quite slow but you managed 
to actually uh recover quite well so where  
do you think you could improve like 
individual changes or small changes  
where do you think you could improve to 
make sure that you can close out the next  
matchups uh sorry this question is for 
any of the players or for the coach yeah
um I think we started store is mainly because 
we got a game plan wrong this thing we were  
trying something different today and I think 
it really didn't pay off and I I think props  
the players at halfway through they realize 
it was going wrong and they man to adjust  
themselves um you know I think we just got 
to get better at the prep work do a little  
bit better come up with a better game plan 
and then maybe we will start a little bit  
stronger I mean we won we won most of the 
pist rounds today so I think we had a good  
chance of actually carrying on momentum 
but unfortunately I think um J too good
today okay thank you thank you thank 
you are there any questions in the
room come up to the mic over
here I'm I'm I'm from B Gamer 
agency and my question is how  
do you and your team feel were the 
match challenging and aspects of this
match um could you could you repeat the 
question okay sorry uh how do you and  
your team feel where the most 
challenging as aspects of this  
match most challenging aspects 
of this game yeah anyone want to
that yeah what was the most 
challenging um I think more like
uh like Ching the game plan where we were getting 
like snowball you know during the game I think  
that's why like one of the hardest thing like we 
couldn't figure it out like as soon as possible  
that's why the score like 48 like both map so 
yeah I think you know what we're doing that's  
the most challenging thing so you know I feel as 
though we ran into a stack every single round on  
T side like regardless of both Maps you know so I 
think we we need to figure it out thank you thank
you thank you strafe Esports so this question 
is for Coach Alex so obviously you have one more  
chance in the coming in tomorrow so what can 
you take away from this match that you think  
would help you in the future matchup against 
either Sentinels are loud any one of them
uh what what can we I mean definitely don't do 
what we did today I think um we to hesitate yet  
today yes maybe maybe we hesitated a bit too much 
um again you know we're trying something new and  
I think it's not working so it's back to the 
drawing board you know I'm not sure what we're  
going to do tomorrow but it's probably going to 
be something we have um it's probably going to  
be something that we practicing you know know over 
the course of like the last couple of months maybe  
we have to go back to something that we used to 
do I think uh the experiment today is a disaster
you all right thank you thank 
you thank you Final Call for
questions all right that concludes our 
press conference today with paper Rex thank
you
