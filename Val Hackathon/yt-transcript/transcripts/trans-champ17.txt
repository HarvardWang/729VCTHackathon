for the next sment we have here H fanatic uh 
thank you guys for being here sharing your  
talks and comments with us today uh so now 
we will open the floor to question from the  
media uh please remember raise your hand 
and we call on you our first question is
from you have for be yeah I have a little bit 
lighter or funnier question maybe for for Alpha  
year um there was this joke of the curse of kind 
of standing up and like trash talking to their  
team were like waving to them during timeouts 
where like after you did it it was like oh you  
didn't win another round on Lotus or oh you went 
to OT after celebrating uh do you think that was  
kind of just like Karma or curse or what do you 
think of like that chance that that happened I  
mean it's not about being cursed because I 
watch a lot of M and last year when the bo  
win the Champions he was always standing up and 
yesterday when SZ playing Z is was standing up I  
think it wasn't curse we just today we played bad 
it wasn't curse or something we just played bad  
thank you thank you next question is from hey guys 
consideration on the loss uh my question is for  
bster uh do you think the slow start on the first 
map led to uh led to the loss in the first map  
and uh going to this it was again a slow start but 
you guys did manage to come back uh but at the end  
uh you didn't cross the finish line what do you 
think was the reason behind the slow start in both  
the games um we we threw like a few rounds um our 
coms just weren't there we weren't uh and seeing  
the gaps in certain rounds um and so we just it we 
threw and then we went 33 and we managed to bring  
it back despite in my opinion it should have been 
a 5 nil at least well 4-1 I'd say had we'd won the  
pistol because that pistol should never be lost 
and then yeah I think then we just started going  
into panic mode um we started getting a bit too 
flustered people started getting emotional then  
we start talking more instead of just kind of 
focusing on the game and enjoying the game uh  
obviously it's hard to enjoy it when with throwing 
or like there's rounds that we should have won and  
then yeah once the mood kind of drops it's very 
difficult for anyone to perform or thrive in so  
it was kind of a slow slow burn after that some 
people go quiet and some yeah it was just like  
bit rubbish really from the Lotus side um but 
it could have gone either way if we'd actually  
won the first pistol we could have started off uh 
snowballing and then on Abyss uh we just need to  
clean up our trading I guess sometimes um but it's 
so difficult you know we're on stage and we're  
literally [ __ ] the bed and um yeah it's it's 
just it's just land matches you know it's just  
it is what it is so it's you look back at it and 
you be like ah well we could have won if we'd uh  
been a bit more composed but at the same time it's 
just tough just to follow up quick on do you think  
it was uh off day for everyone in the team or was 
it just uh you guys came prepared but it wasn't  
the day um no I I'm everyone had their individual 
rounds hero on Abyss Dera also on abyss and then  
Alfia with his clutch too and Chronicle with his 
as well so like everyone was shooting and getting  
the frags that they needed to get it's just like 
the easy rounds we're just losing the easy ones  
and that was the problem like when you when you're 
given a 5v3 you have to convert it it's so free  
uh but we we like I said we just uh we lose a guy 
and then we just lose to solo deaths in Stupid  
Ways on both maps and then it's just that's just 
it's just valerant you know it's it's discipline  
from practice goes into a real game or it's 
just us not really knowing fully what to do  
we're uncomfortable so uh but also we do really 
well sometimes when we are uncomfortable and when  
we're talking and stuff uh we can sometimes 
pull it out it was just today uh we got too  
emotional I think and then it it ruin the Vibes 
thank you and all the best for your next match
cheers okay uh next question is from uh
Andres hi guys ER my my name is Andre I work for 
prin a sports um I'd like to start by giving you  
all a lot of encouragements I know it's difficult 
and frustrating to lose like this but I know from  
F hand that you guys tend to come back in to 
test moments in fact while I was looking at  
your R map I was reminded of the comeback you had 
against lout on ice box where you were able to  
come back from a 31 again deficit and my question 
is for darkam booster I know you play much better  
under pressure in the lower bracket you have 
mostly done well uh will we see more Fanatic  
in this tournament and how do you look against 
your next opening G2 the Le B and European
classic I don't know uh for myself I don't really 
feel any pressure going to lower brackets like it  
feels like another day usually uh we did that 
for many years in a row now many events so I  
think we're chilling on that especially myself 
I don't know like I am not really stressed about  
lower bracket I'm more happy because know 
other teams like to kind of stress out on  
that and yeah for me I don't know G2 match 
I know it's like European special but I I  
don't know I think they got two scar was in 
Europe and went to na so I I don't know it's  
going to be a good match I think I mean they're 
doing really good uh yeah we'll see tomorrow I
guess thank you so much uh 
next question is from better
hey guys uh likewise commiss is on the loss uh 
hopefully you guys can bounce back in the next  
match got a question for the coach uh giving 
a little bit out of what BOS said about what  
went down in the both maps in this series I kind 
of want to uh have you expand on the first map  
specifically and given the fact that uh uh the 
first map is mostly been has mostly been uh one  
of the team's strongest map this year I mean 
what do you think was the the biggest reason  
from your point of view as to why uh is things 
didn't go your way I mean yeah you're right  
we're one of the best lest teams in the world 
um but we lost that pistol 4v2 on the a site  
just no one said anything or was aware of that 
opening uh through the front of the site and  
it just broke the team it didn't matter what 
happened or what we said from then on it was  
just like we just weren't in the mood like 
even the rounds that we won after that like  
I think went down Z3 and then we won in 
a row or something they were like messy  
like chaotic wins where they kind of we just won 
a few gun fights so yeah I don't know it was just  
yeah just losing that 4v2 it was just from there 
we just couldn't recover we couldn't communicate  
properly um and we weren't we just weren't focused 
we weren't using our freeze times effectively we  
weren't using mid rounds effectively it 
was just just chaos yeah we couldn't fix
it okay thanks so much uh next question is from AR
hi hi again am I audible hello am I audible yeah 
we can okay good my question is again for booster  
uh of course this is not the favorable situation 
uh you guys and what G2 wants to face each other  
in elimination match but I remember you talking 
about facing vein and since you haven't faced AIA  
uh at any of the internet national match games uh 
what's what will be the mindset coming to the game  
and uh looking at their match and your match 
today uh how confident are you going towards  
tomorrow's game um I think it will be up to uh 
yeah first off yeah it'll be fun to play against  
G2 because we haven't played against them uh 
that that team ever um and they've been to  
events with us and we've we've somehow managed 
to dodge each other so firstly it'll be fun to  
play them and and secondly I think the results 
are really based on us like we are our biggest  
losers our biggest competition like it didn't 
feel today Heretics were that good it was just  
we felt like pretty dog um and yeah I mean I got 
nine frags in two maps so there we go uh so yeah  
when it comes to G2 it just really depends how the 
boys feel if they do what their roles are and if  
they they they bring the atmosphere and keep the 
atmosphere uh like even on the abyss comeback then  
people were starting to feel it again and then 
we started to play well it's there no mystery  
why we are good it's when the atmosphere is good 
um and if we start panicking then we're going to  
lose to G22 and then uh the boys are going to 
be going home so but whatever happens happens  
it's just up to us whether we want to stay in 
this tournament or not and do our job thank you  
much uh we don't have more question is the call 
maybe we have one more question here in the room
oh thank you uh f for being here and good luck 
en next match thank you thank you thank you
