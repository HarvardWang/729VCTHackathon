we are joined by team Heretics who are coming off 
of their Victory uh off of their match against I  
cannot put my headset um Okay can I'm stupid 
I can you got it we will begin with questions  
from the remote media and then move to the 
in-house media uh Pedro if you'd like to
begin yes this is Pedro Romero uh first 
off congrats to you guys for M for  
uh defeating Sentinels moving on to the low 
bracket finals and extending your stay in  
this event for at least another day uh gotta 
Gotta Give a question towards woot I'm gonna  
have to fast forward to the very last round 
of the series in itself I gotta know uh from  
your point of view exactly what went down 
because you were in that 1v2 clutch with  
Sassi and Z facing you and he took down 
sassy and then uh you saw z um approach  
you to uh kill you and then finish off that round 
and extend the series obviously that didn't happen  
you came out on top in that final uh uh fight 
just want to know what was going on in your mind  
when that happened and and and yeah your thought 
process and all that stuff uh sik came so close  
to sing to me I understood it and I aim like for 
on the middle and I literally like killed him so  
easy because he made a mistake I think because 
because he K he picked me I killed him I thought  
he you know don't have after off because if he had 
updraft you to updraft and they need double pick  
I think like that and I killed him I got my ult I 
tried to ult he updraft I just canceled my ult he  
missed right click and I killed him it's happened 
like that I think they they made mistake now
it thank you uh we'll take the next question 
from Fernando uh thank you so first of all  
congratulations on the win and F from game aren 
Brazil uh my question goes for anyone who want to  
answer so this win from Heretics is the first 
time since 2021 an EMA team got to top three  
Champions do you guys believe you can bring 
this home to Ema for the first time in a long
time I can answer yeah uh I mean for me personally 
I didn't even play Bor in 2021 so you know I I  
think the for the pass doesn't really matter 
um I think the game has changed a lot since  
then and we're working really hard I think the 
form that we're in right now is is really good  
we we had a slow start but um you know we won 
and that's what matters and we're just going to  
keep taking it one game at a time and yeah we'll 
we'll see how it goes yeah I I was 15 and was 16  
and don't was 16 as well so I think that's 
why could even play VCT he could even play  
for me I wasn't able to even play in the 
Turkish League like know vcl thanks guys good  
luck tomorrow thank you thank you thanks we'll 
go next to arnab hey guys my congratulations  
on the win first of all my question is for Benji 
fishy uh I want to know uh inspiration behind the  
walk out with the T suit is it from alpha or did 
you got your own uh I mean I always had the idea  
of like getting all the all the boys to wear tibus 
hats since I was wearing one all the time I I'm I  
like to think you know I kind of like evolved into 
like this big bear suit now because I don't know  
we're like top four of Champs uh but yeah I mean 
I wanted to do it for um the grand finals in stage  
two but we didn't make it U not not the not like 
the the be suit But like everyone wearing hats and  
for the be suit I kind of just like uh I manager 
Nicholas I told him to go buy some tib hats and he  
messed me was like there's a b there's a there's 
a tiers onesie I was like yeah get it might as  
well and yeah that was basically it so yeah thank 
you and I expect some more lockouts in the remain  
of the mates I'll try I'll try to think of some 
thank you thank you thank you we'll go next to  
Sierra hello first off congratulations on your win 
you have my support hopefully moving forward and  
winning Grand finals and at all um my question 
goes out to anybody um on the team as minib bu  
uh you tweeted and many have kind of noticed 
your interational debut was a close one to loss  
against Sentinels and now you've ended Sentinel 
season with your win over them today at Champions  
what do you think have been the biggest changes 
within the team between then and now Beyond in  
the roster lineup and what do you think have been 
your biggest growth points that led to this win
today I can answer suppose I think for me like 
it's just been part of the process of going to  
all these events and back when we played in Madrid 
I think everyone was just so happy to qualify to  
Madrid you know and it's like everyone's first 
time on the big stage and yeah like we had a  
pretty tough group I think we ended up playing 
two of the best teams in the event and we still  
did well so it was mostly just back then it 
was kind of like super hyped for us to be you  
know just in Madrid but we learned so much from 
that and we've just evolved every single event  
and obviously we had Patty as well stand in 
who did an incredible job um so yeah I think  
we've just evolved so much as a team and yeah 
like everyone's just better players now we've  
we've kept up our fundamentals and we've kept 
consistent and these kind of stages don't phase  
us anymore which is is nice you know I think we 
learned a lot from Madrid from shangai and now
here thank you we'll go next to Pedro
Romero Neil said uh a little bit just now about 
the subject that I want to talk want to ask about  
in this question Patty Tech he returned to the 
team uh a few days ago maybe yesterday I might  
be wrong and that you guys can correct me on 
that uh I saw on a TW one of the recent posts  
on the on on the team's X account and sort of 
Benji fishy was like very a gast you know eyes  
eyes wide open mouth dropped down just want to ask 
you guys to everyone that would like to answer um  
exactly you know what was your reaction when you 
saw Patty te return to uh you guys for for this  
final stretch of the regular of this season and 
how much of an effect that has that have brought  
it to the team from that until to now can I answer 
guys yeah because there's a specific story behind  
this uh so I actually wanted to bring PTY here 
in Grand Final and I asked my manager to bring  
him and he said okay we will ask to the team 
and then we will see and then one day passed  
two they passed and he didn't ask to team and I 
was like why is he ignoring that and I was like  
kind of said and I said can I ask to the team 
and he said no but it was already locked in  
he booked flights he booked everything and I 
text to Patty back and I said bro they don't  
let you come you know it's unlucky but at 
least I tried and he said it's fine bro at  
least you tried that's what matter and then 
I was like okay there's no chance he's coming  
so like it's it was over for me and then uh 
all right hey everybody on the call we have  
uh returned sorry we had some minor technical 
difficulties um we'll take the next question from
Pedro well before the feed was disconnected I just 
wanted to ask well once again about what I asked  
before I cut off Reen you were talking a little 
bit about um Patty Tech returning unfortunately  
we were able to hear uh what you said uh in the 
direction so if if if it's okay would you mind  
just doing a a repeat of that story of how that 
kind of came together of of course it's kind of  
long though sorry so I wanted to bring py here 
uh for Grand Final and I asked my manager can  
can can we bring him here and then he said okay 
we can try we can talk to the team blah blah and  
then one day pass two day pass he didn't ask 
anybody in the team and then I was like why  
is he ignoring that and I asked him Nicholas 
is our manager by the way I asked him that can  
we ask to the team and then he said no and I was 
like so shocked but it was already locked in he  
uh like secretly you know he already booked 
everything flights like everything and then I text  
py back I said bro I tried but he he said no like 
something like this and then yesterday morning uh  
we were in the room and Nicholas said uh guys we 
need to take picture for content and then he was  
vlogging the picture like I was uh feeling weird 
why is he vlogging that it's just the picture and  
then after like five 10 seconds Pat just came into 
the room and everybody was so shocked in our team  
like it was so happy moment for everybody I think 
because everybody loves PTY in in our team and  
uh like during the year he worked so hard with us 
and he brought us his experience and everything so  
thanks P we love you yeah thank you uh we'll take 
the next question from Sierra yeah um my question  
question goes to mini boo um during your postmatch 
interview um you said something along the lines  
of no diffing no trash talk before the game this 
time I just want a strategic 5v5 for your rematch  
against levaton versus you know beforehand before 
your last match up against some you were tweeting  
kind of oh I'm going to add one more jet diff to 
this list and you know what time it is it's time  
to diff OS uh what kind of caused the mental 
change was it kind of getting humbled during  
that last match or is it just because it's a best 
of five now and the stakes are higher than ever  
what was the change of heart I mean the mindset 
it didn't change his behavior before the match  
changed like uh I'm still going to play better 
than him and we are going to play better as a  
team and uh like you know I don't know like I'm 
just doing this all for fun there is no like real  
mentality like mental be behind it that like now 
I'm scared or then I thought like oh yeah yeah  
yeah let's go you know like uh there is no like 
anything for this I'm sometimes doing it for fun  
and yeah like that's it we're just going to 
play the game you know and uh we played the  
game previous time and like as a team they play it 
better like it's not aspas or something you know  
and we played Wars as a team and yeah that's all 
about it it's just like yapping for no reason you
know thank you we'll take the next question from 
the room hello hello and it's a little question  
and what was full like for the younger members of 
the team just like brother or anything can answer  
any anyone can answer you I think uh I mean I can 
answer it's like everyone in the team including  
Buu um I mean we're all family like everyone up 
here everyone over there um he Nicholas Weber  
we're all family um we're all brothers and you 
know someone being older you know is it doesn't  
make them like any different or you know just 
cuz we're kids I guess um but yeah I think we're  
we're all just brothers so yeah thank you thank 
you um we'll take the next question from Sala
hello guys and congrats with a huge win thank 
you uh excited about your next match um so my  
question is a followup about one of the brothers 
I think that rans played insanely on on the ABS  
map and it's like the third map and high pressure 
and uh uh every time I'm at the press conference  
andrians he compliments other team members he 
cheers everyone up so a small question to your  
teammates uh what what role uh ran plays in the 
team as a player and as a person and I feel he's  
always like shy and uh I just wanted to give him 
the spotlight and to hear some shout out from his  
teammates I want start okay so an has been like 
really shy boy you know like he's like the glue  
of the team the support he's like flashing for us 
and blah blah and maybe like in the first ER part  
of the year like statistically he wasn't like uh 
performing that good but he was like doing that  
job and like like he always had the job that no 
one notices and like his job is really important  
like being kind of can I swear or not you can 
spare okay he's like a [ __ ] of the team you  
know and he's doing that like hard job that 
no one like likes it but he does it and it's  
like the most important job and uh like right 
now his form is just insane like like like you  
didn't notice how he became the best player in 
the world like it's insane like his starts like  
and his place and I don't know like he's still 
doing that that black job like the the dirty job  
the big job but uh like he puts up the numbers as 
well you know I think if you ask like anyone um  
like to speak about how Enz like impacts the team 
they would have a lot to say um I think we could  
talk about enz's role and how good he does it for 
like probably the next hour um but yeah I mean a  
lot of time he goes unnoticed I think recently 
just because of how good he's been performing  
how many Clips he's getting in these recent games 
people are only now starting to notice but he's  
been doing it from from the start U of the team 
and in the team we we will appreciate him a lot  
um everything I mean he's my favorite person 
to play on a site with like me and him we we  
hold anything down on any map we're on a site 
together I feel most comfortable with ERS um so  
yeah no I think he everyone you know appreciates 
him so much yeah I want to add um it's not that  
he's just randomly so good and perfect I think he 
improved the most like since the beginning of the  
team in October or something I think he's the most 
improved player in person like he improved a lot  
so many different sides like mentally in game how 
he talks how he behaves I think he matured a lot  
and right now he's our most stable player our most 
I know reliable player so but it's not random it's  
because of the work he put in and because he 
listens listen to his coaches and still listens  
sometimes so like it's like it's well deserved 
like everything yeah even I'll add something on  
to that like I think he has a pleasure a coach and 
me and Weber you know I mean we love working with  
everyone in the team but like Boo said it's not a 
coincidence like he's literally like a sponge like  
you telling us something he'll do it he won't 
question it he won't talk back he'll just do  
it and he'll listen and he wants to improve every 
day and he grinds every single day he does it in a  
healthy manner he doesn't just sit there until his 
eyes bleed like he'll take proper breaks he looks  
after him self he looks after his teammates and 
he's just a genuinely wonderful human so I don't  
know it's not a it's not a coincidence and like 
the guys I said he is literally like the glue of  
the team and I'm glad that he's you know starting 
to get the spot because he deserves it yeah these  
guys didn't left anything to say so yeah I agree 
okay we all love thank you so much guys I'm so shy  
right now I don't want to talk you I mean yeah I'm 
just so happy to hear all of these things because  
I mean I don't like to be honest I don't need to 
be on Spotlight to perform well or or anything  
like I actually don't mind people don't uh like 
how say sharing me on social media and stuff like  
I just do this job for myself and for my team you 
know like I need to perform well every single game  
because my teammates deserves it and I deserve 
it as well so I just do my job and that's it but  
thank you so much I love you thank you that was 
incredibly sweet uh can I ask one more question  
yeah so this question will be to the head coach 
at the press conference I asked the question  
but unfortunately we couldn't hear your answer 
but then due to the lack of time the question  
was like what will be the most defining Factor 
Why team Heretics can go the long way and since  
you've gone even further uh since that moment I 
I am still curious about your answer I think for  
me the every single one of these guys I mean me 
Weber Nicholas we tell them every single day like  
you have got what it takes to win Champions 
it's just about whether we're ready or not  
and for me being ready is consistency like if 
we consistently perform how we know we can if  
we can step up and play to our level like these 
guys can can win but at the same time like I I  
just want us to focus on the next game you know 
like for me it's just taking it game by game not  
getting carried away all I care about is how we 
perform tomorrow about Leiden and then then you  
know whatever happens whatever happens happens 
if we're able able enough to bring the level I  
know we can and these guys know we can we'll 
win it's kind of as simple as that like we've  
prepared really well throughout the entire year 
we have good prep now the prep's already hammered  
you know like these guys know all the answers 
they know what they need to do um it's just a  
case of going out there and making sure we can 
do it thank you for sharing it and good luck  
in the next round thank you thank you thank you 
thank you and we'll take the final question from
Pedro yes uh this question goes out towards um 
Benji um as everyone knows you know you're very  
experienced in just having to be in these kinds of 
situations before and even right now um you know  
going back into your previous in your in your 
previous game in fortnite and then even now um  
with yourself and the team doing well in Shanghai 
doing well in EMA and even now doing well right  
now in Champions um as you and the team kind of 
look ahead towards this rematch against leviatan  
um what's the mindset going to be like you know 
how are you guys going to take in uh not only on  
Preparation but more so just kind of uh trying 
to to maintain this sense of unity uh while also  
dealing with the high stakes that company this up 
upcoming match because this is the lower bracket  
final and and stuff like that um yeah it's a good 
question I think um in terms of like I don't know  
it being like super high stakes I don't think it 
bothers any of us um we you know we're I feel like  
we're so close with each other that you know we 
all have have each other's backs and when we're  
on stage where it's still just the same like 
five people that have been grinding this past  
eight months um like just on the stage like it 
doesn't it doesn't matter how important the game  
is it doesn't matter how many people are watching 
doesn't matter how many people land in the arena  
we're going to play the same we're going to 
you know just do our job and I think right  
now we're doing our jobs pretty well so yeah 
thank you we actually had two more questions  
come in from uh the time media this first one's 
going to go to mini boo um we understand that  
this is your first major tournament how do you 
handle the pressure before each match and how  
do your teammates support you how do I handle 
the pressure um I mean I feel pressure before  
every game because I'm excited to play because 
I'm young and I'm eager to win I want to play  
you know like as Brandon Weber said like when 
you don't feel anything that's when you have to  
stop and obviously like I feel the pressure and I 
love that and I use it to my benefit you know and  
how do I handle that um I mean it's just my daily 
routine like I like to do some card in the morning  
so I get out that like maybe unne necessary 
stress you know like I just work hard and um  
I don't have like any overthinking thoughts in my 
head and then I just try to stay away avoid the  
social media listen to music spend time with my 
friends you know and in the end like there is no  
people there is no Spectators there is no arena 
there is just all five of us with two coaches  
that we hear on the stage and it's just like us 
chilling in Berlin office like casual every day  
like every PR and I hear my boys and I just think 
about the game and yeah that's it thank you and  
this is going to be the last question Benji it's 
coming to you yeah uh tomorrow you'll be facing  
levaton again what plans do you and the team have 
to make the outcome different uh I mean this time  
I think I think the big reason we lost against 
Lev before we just weren't playing like ourselves  
um I think we saw some of it today and we 
win so I think I don't know I mean start  
of the game today like we just we weren't 
playing like ourselves which is why I mean  
the Haven we lost I think I don't know I I 
feel like whenever we play like ourselves and  
we play have confidence and we're speaking to 
each other then nobody in the world can be us  
including love so we're just going to focus on 
that Heretics thank you so much for taking the  
time to speak with us and congratulations 
on your Victory thank you thank you
