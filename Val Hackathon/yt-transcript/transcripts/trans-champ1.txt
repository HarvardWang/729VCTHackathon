welcome to the champion Soul preent press 
conference today we are joined by texture  
tens Berlin and Benji fishy we'll begin with some 
presubmit questions first and then we'll move to  
the remote media we have about 50 people in here 
watching uh plus more online that aren't actively  
asking questions um tens we'll go to you first 
uh this is a question from Paul Ferguson from vr.  
how do you feel about facing jeni in your Opening 
match and what can you use from your previous  
match at the Masters Madrid finals that will 
help you in this one jeni is a really good team  
uh they beat basically everyone that they play 
so they're a really tough opponent to be matched  
against uh as the first seed but I think same goes 
for us I think we're a dangerous fourth seed to go  
against so I think um definitely going to be a fun 
match to watch for sure and it'll be interesting  
awesome uh Benji we're going to go to you next 
this one's coming from the valerin competitive  
comput Community uh Team heretic struggled a lot 
with fatigue and stress due to lack of breaks in  
stage two M Mia how do you guys feel after the 
break for Champs does the team feel rejuvenated  
are you ready for the tournament um yeah I mean 
I think if I speak for myself like I was I felt  
super bur out um especially towards the end 
of uh split 2 like I wasn't like if I if I  
go back to to kind of like kick off in stage one 
I was playing just a lot more like just outside  
of like officials and scrims um but I was able to 
take like a a four five day break back in England  
and it was same with everyone like we were went 
back home saw our families and stuff which yeah  
I think it's it's helped me a lot especially um 
I think this being the last one of the Year helps  
me a lot because I know after this I'm done um I'm 
going to go on you know a holiday so you know I'm  
I'm good um I feel like I I'm a lot more motivated 
so yeah I think it's helped me especially and just  
the rest of the team it's it's helped us a lot 
and we can tell it's made us improveed for sure  
thank you uh if you have a question please use 
the zoom handra function and we'll call on you  
um we'll begin with uh Allan yeah this is question 
for tin hi tin can you hear me yeah hi I'm addan  
and I'm talking to you from China here so um 
speaking about Sentinel so you are you are the  
only team that have is not have not entered in not 
top four in playoffs but inter Champions so do you  
feel that this will give you some a feelings 
of being being an underdog or something like
that so it definitely um it definitely wasn't 
our greatest showing in the America's playoffs  
but uh I do think that um coming to Korea we 
were able to talk about some stuff that was  
kind of going wrong for us and I do think 
that we were getting a little bit burnt so  
just having a nice little break and then 
uh being able to qualify for Champs I do  
think it was really nice and so uh this 
event we're just putting in our all to  
just play the best that we can okay thank 
you thank you we'll go next to Brandon from
esports.com
well uh here in the final stages 
of the year uh considering just how  
well the organization has done 
overall in Esports in 2024
[Music]
well there's no pressure for us coming from that 
because you know our league team they've been  
doing pretty well for such a long time so we would 
always watch their game and be like oh they're so  
good but um for us it's our own league and it's 
our own game so we just try to play our own game  
thank you we'll go next to Tong Tong from Billy
Billy uh
um
do you me to translate the chese yeah so the 
question was it seems like on at a stage two  
it wasn't a really good start for fpx but when 
you get into the playoffs seems like you guys  
have BCE back and then you came to the the champ 
Champions seems like you have two Group B but  
seems like there was two Champions and one runner 
up seems like it this a pressure or motivation  
for you guys and burnie's answer was that um at 
stage one feels like we have enough motivation  
but when it comes to stage two we rest a little 
bit seems like we have a BCE back of course the  
form didn't as well as when we was in stage one 
but now we see the group with see the group stage  
and we are in the group b but we think every 
four team for every group is also well because  
each Champions everything team is so strong so 
it wouldn't be too much pressure but also for  
but I will consider that as a motivation 
for us thank you we'll go next to Pedro
Romero yes uh hello first off um 
good to see you guys in Champion  
uh got a question for 10 of course you know 
looking at your career this is not the first  
time you you've gotten to this level you know 
first time being in 20121 the inaugural Edition  
and of course you know what would happened 
in Sentinels was you know losing to crew I  
want to ask you now that you have returned to 
Champions after a gap of three years what are  
some takeaways that you made from that event 
that you feel now you that you put to use for  
this occasion and and and also how much have you 
have you grown from that you know disappointing  
loss to crew going forward so definitely the 
2021 showing of chance was quite disappointing  
for uh me the rest of the team senal at the 
time and so it is a good learning experience  
cuz um just being defeated in that fashion and 
um kind of knowing where our gameplay lacked uh  
I I do think I was able to improve a lot more as 
a teammate and I I think that going into this ch  
s were the best Sentinels iteration that's 
ever been um like this five is probably the  
most consistent and scariest team to play against 
uh for Asel team so I'm very proud to be a part  
of that and I think that we can definitely do 
damage at this event um if we do play up to our
standards thank you we'll go next to
Rael hey guys uh my question goes to Benji 
um coming from a S great legacy as the the  
one you build in fortnite uh what does it feel 
like to have once again rade the words Elite  
now in valerant and in your first Champions um 
yeah I mean it's pretty amazing uh I think I I  
kind of dreamt of this ever since I first off to 
valerant um you know I always I mean I remember I  
got invited in 22 Champions isul just as like a 
streamer um and like I was always hoping that I  
would you know be there on stage I I remember 
watching like the loud optic game and I don't  
know it's super cool um to now be here in 
person only like two years later from when  
I was invited as just a streamer um you know I 
feel like I've worked really hard to get here  
and yeah I hope people like can recognize that 
and see how hard I've worked so yeah I mean it's  
it's a really great feeling to know 
that everything's kind of paid off so
yeah thank you we'll go next to Antonio 
Romero yes thank you my question is also  
for Ben fishi first of all congratulations on 
qualifying and uh this is the first event you  
will attend as a whole team without standin how 
is this impacting you as a group and how do you  
think it will impact the matches um yeah I mean 
I think um it's definitely it's it's obviously  
a lot easier than playing with a stand in I mean 
Shanghai uh was kind of like a miracle one for us  
like we only had one day of practice uh practice 
with Patty before we played um but I think a big  
reason why we did so good in Shanghai was we had 
um no expectations for ourselves we kind of just  
went out um playing to have fun and we're going 
to go in with the same mentality for Champions  
we're just going to take it one one game at a 
time you know you you try your best has to play  
good you know um you can't you can't control 
winning or losing right you can only control  
if you're playing good or if you're not playing 
good you can play good any other team that's plays  
better um so we're just going to focus on trying 
to play good valerant and yeah hopefully we'll be  
able to show um how good our team can actually be 
at this event thank you we'll go next to One Plus
C
and so the question was compared to 
must Shanghai do you think what's  
the Breakthrough for the team and his uh 
burnie's answer was that uh I think the  
past word stage has all proved that we keep 
improving and everybody can see we are keep  
improving and I wouldn't say that um we 
will like play every time like pre like  
doing it perfect but we will keep improving 
every time in every International tourn
thank you we'll go next to strafe Fe
Sports thank you so uh this question is 
for texture so now that you're playing  
in Champions in front of a home crowd does 
this excite you or does or do you think or  
is it absolutely uh terrifying and also do 
you think playing in front of a home crowd  
gives some sort of an advantage to you guys and 
also the other Korean team DRX or do you think  
it actually acts as some sort of a detriment 
uh can you repeat the first question the first  
part uh sorry so the first part is you know 
that they're playing champions in their home  
crowd so does this excite them or do you think 
or do they think that it's absolutely terrifying
I don't think it's going to be detrimental to 
our performance at all uh more so I think it's  
going to help us but it's just something that 
we haven't really thought about you know back  
in Masters Madrid or Masters Shanghai but I do 
think that getting all the support from the fans  
and especially the home fans will help us all 
right thank you thank you we'll go next to Tong
dang hi uh everyone can listen to me and 
can hear me yes we can hear you yeah yeah  
uh this question for t uh after the assess 
of F vity State one and St state two and  
not participating in mat Shanghai what have 
you and your team PR play and chain before
Champion so I do think uh it was quite 
disappointing to miss out on Master Shanghai but  
at the same time it was nice for us to have a bit 
of a break um leading up to attempting to qualify  
for Champs and eventually here at Champs now uh 
overall cuz the team was put together back last  
year uh near the um the start of Champs I think 
and so we were practicing for quite a bit with  
John we later uh kept playing we participated in 
uh AA which was also um a tournament here in Korea  
and so we've been playing non-stop for quite a 
bit and so just having that time to kind of relax  
and change up our game plan a little bit work 
on ourselves but also um just breathe a little  
bit and um come back with more excited mentality 
towards the game I think was really important for
us thank you we'll go next to Robia from Jinx TV 
thank you Anon uh hello everyone um my question  
is to tens I want to ask about how the teams 
moral and fatigue uh is right now given that  
we heard there were some issues with the team 
during stage two uh with Saucy and then with  
John Guy having health health issues can you let 
us know how is the team feeling right now coming  
into the Champions I think in this moment 
time I think we're the most excited that  
we've been to uh play CU I mean the whole year 
ends in Champs right and uh just being able to  
play up until this point I guess we're going 
to use all our excitement now and release it  
all on stage thank you so much and good luck 
everyone thank you thank you we'll go next to
Ravish ravish your mic is um not picking 
up we'll come back to you um arnab we'll  
go to you next hey guys uh my question is 
for texture uh at the start of the season  
I asked you about uh how do you place 
yourself as a dualist and now since  
you have won the Visa City Pacific dualist 
of the year coming into the Champions and  
after the so much experience throughout 
the season how would you rate yourself  
among the top players right now competing in 
the team uh in the sorry uh in the champions
[Music]
condition
well uh I guess now I can put myself on 
the list of good deal list I'm not that  
bad I guess I've been playing decent um but it 
really depends on uh you know who's feeling it  
on the day and how you're really feeling 
in the server on the day uh of um we have  
great players like Zen and aspas who can 
also pop off whenever they're feeling it  
so I wouldn't say I'm the best duelist in the 
world but I'm close I would say just a small  
followup in it if you win master uh if you win 
uh Champions would you consider yourself the
best yeah I guess for a little bit if we do it 
but for a short period of time thank you everyone  
and best of luck to everyone thank you uh I think 
ravish fixed his mic ravish will try to you next  
sweet all thanks guys appreciate it myad about 
that uh firstly hey What's Going anyone uh my  
questions for Benji quick firstly killer hat mate 
just lapsy rock in that as usual uh wanted to ask  
uh so do you think you could go band for band 
with either everybody on this table or anybody  
in Champs even even M for M perhaps oh I 
mean I've got tens next to me bro let's be  
real he does give competition let's be real 
like he's got the final Mouse he's got this  
like come on I'm not getting 20K viewers 
on on Twitch right now uh but I think uh  
I mean Esports earnings I think I I've got 
the the most uh so I guess I I'll take I'll  
take that um yeah I think I've got I think 
think I'm doing pretty good so I'm I guess  
great question thank you thanks mate cheers 
Che Tyson would you like to offer a rebuttal
please uh I don't
know all right uh thank you we'll go next to uh
Valeria hello guys and welcome to Soul 
uh I actually have two questions if I  
may ask first question is to tens uh Group 
B is commonly referred as a group of death  
uh and taking in consideration the obvious 
challenges of starting your Champions Run in  
such a challenging environment do you see 
it also as a positive experience for your
team so I I would also agree that the the 
group is probably the group of death um I  
think there's been no real like easy Road for us 
but I do think it's a good thing uh if you want  
to be the best you have to beat the best and 
being able to do that in the group stage would  
be pretty good thank you and my SEC my second 
question is to Benji fishy uh recently mini Buu  
was complaining about absolutely unforgiving 
apack ranked players so I would like to hear  
a couple of thoughts about like the difference in 
play style between different regions from you and  
how is your adaptation process and generally how 
you feel about Champions being in Sol this year  
thank you um yeah I mean okay if we're talking 
about ranked uh apack ranked is is definitely  
harder than than Europe um I mean if I play 
ascendant lobbies in Europe it's it's pretty  
it's pretty easy but over here yeah my God you've 
got some youve got some crazy players but a lot a  
lot of people don't talk which in Europe I think 
people talk more um but you know yeah the players  
are definitely better at lower ranks than apack 
um and about uh chance being so uh South Korea  
was uh one of my two places that I always wanted 
to visit um the two were South Korea and Japan and  
while I'm here uh I'm going to stay in South Korea 
till I mean for example if we get eliminated early  
then I'm going to stay in South Korea until after 
finals and then after I'm going to Japan so I'm  
kind of knocking you know uh two off both of them 
off so yeah I'm really happy um I'm excited to um  
get to meet the the fans you know the crowd 
as always um yeah I'm really excited so yeah  
thank you thank you thank you we'll go next to 
azrey from go gosu Gamers thanks very much um  
it's really a question directed to Benji because 
like someone mentioned that's an awesome hat you  
have by the way um and this is the first one 
I think we've noticed that it's a different  
hat compared to the previous two tournaments 
so maybe a more of a light-hearted question  
what gives what's the significant of the hats 
to you and would you like have any different  
hats for different occasions as well or just 
for tournaments and orts related ond oh I mean  
okay the only reason I wore this one is because 
texture was here that's the only reason I wore it  
I was like okay it's it's a good occasion to 
wear it because he gave me this hat in uh in  
Shanghai so what I was thinking of is if we play 
against geni I'm going to I'm going to uh walk out  
with this hat but in in general I'm just going 
to stick to the to the tippers one um there's  
no there's no like significance to it I just 
think it's a cool hat um so I walk out with it  
so uh yeah no thank you for the question 
maybe as a follow-up texture what do you  
think about Benji saying that he'll actually walk 
out with the head during the match up between you
guys that's cool I'll give you my
hat awesome guys good luck everyone 
for the for Champions thank you than  
uh we'll go next to Alan yes thank you uh so this 
is a question for Bing I would talk in I speak  
English first and I translate to Chinese here 
so this is a question for buring so uh for fpx  
you perform uh like really well in the uh in in 
the master strong first stage in the group stage  
uh in the swiet stage should I say but uh but 
then it feels like you have a little bit bump  
in the split to in China so do you think that 
uh like Beni said maybe it's a miracle for you  
in in master Shanghai and if that's so how do 
you like to reperform that that that that that
event for
[Music]
um
yeah uh so this the bur's answer is actually we 
do think that uh in although we didn't into top  
eight in master shangai we do feel that our our 
performance is a little bit above our expectations  
we don't really uh expect us to be that close 
to the uh to the Champions and run up in master  
Shanghai but uh for this Champions we don't have 
um I I myself and my team don't have a lot of that  
much expectations especially in this group I know 
it's a group of death and I know but T is my role  
model in Valance and salute to tens I always want 
to you know to have to become the opponents of him  
and it's really my dream to uh became his opponent 
on stage and now it's it is my time to reach my  
dream and you know if you want to become the best 
you have to beat the best so this is a very good  
chance for me so thank you thank you we'll do 
two more questions uh Pedro we'll start with
you yes uh uh I got a question for for texture 
as been alluded to a few occasions already in  
this press conferences you know with the solo 
Q situation environment like with all the teams  
coming into Korea and just having to play each 
other yourself included you know I I do remember  
one time you played with woot uh put off a few 
videos funny videos here and there just want  
to ask you what's the experience been like just 
having to play with different people um either as  
a teammate or as an opponent and what's your Bigg 
takeway from just um that all that kind of aspect
well it's not every day that you get the chance 
to play uh you know duo with some other players in  
from other leagues um so being able to do that at 
international events it's pretty special but you  
don't really learn a lot from like playing against 
them them or playing with them it's just purely
fun thank you uh and we'll take the final question 
for this press conference from ravish hey sorry  
hey what's up guys back again uh so just a quick 
final question uh for 10 ahead now Tyson I've  
asked you a couple of times for drip checks 
and I just wanted to see considering this is  
Champ the biggest event of the year have you 
brought anything new in your Arsenal besides  
your your change your rings and your bracelet 
that you that you're usually rocking uh right  
now it's just same old same necklace uh ring 
that I showed you before same bracelet uh so  
nothing really changed I I kind of stick to to 
what I have understandable thanks man yeah uh  
thank you so much for participating we're going to 
take a short break uh as we transition to the next  
group and then we'll be right back we'll be right 
back thank you thank you thank you than everyone
