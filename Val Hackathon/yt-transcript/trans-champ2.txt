hello we are joined by Veen Jing K Kang 
and Mr Fallen um for the members of the  
media there are about 50 people uh 
watching remotely please raise your  
hand if you'd like to ask a question and 
then we'll call on you uh we'll begin with
Brandon awesome thank you very much this one 
to Valen how you doing man um you know we're  
hearing a lot about the group of death you 
know being senal jeni you know Heretics over  
there but I really think you guys might have 
one of the hardest groups you know maybe the  
most underestimated groups in in that sense uh 
so I just like to kind of get your thoughts on  
the field and how tough you think it's going 
to be to make it out yeah I definitely think  
we have one of the hardest groups um there's 
a lot of great players here and a lot of  
experience on these teams um they've competed a 
lot internationally so you know we're one of the  
few teams that haven't got as much experiences 
them so I'm looking at our group and thinking  
like we got a lot of big dogs but um I think 
it's going to be difficult to make it out of  
course you know every team here not only 
our group is prepared and ready to win the  
tournament you know you wouldn't be here if 
you didn't think so um but we think the same  
so I'm feeling confident I think we're going 
to make it out um but it's going to be tough
nevertheless thank you we'll go next to Robia from 
Jinx TV um hi everyone Hi valin my question is to  
you uh it's going to be a long one so bear 
with me first of all congrat congratulations  
once again for being the first Ascension team to 
reach Champions I want to talk about the new rules  
introduced by Riot for 2025 where the Ascension 
teams will get only one year worth of time in  
VCT if they are not able to qualify for Champs or 
survive the rication apart from this the number  
of teams in VCT will be fixed going forward 
that is 12 what are your thoughts about these  
new rules do you think these are a bit unfair for 
Ascension teams coming from tough tier to circuit  
given that the team only play has like 10 to 12 
chances to Flinch their spots in international  
events or Champions and it's pretty short time 
to learn and grow especially in the current meta  
also do you think to make it a bit more unfair 
or sorry Fair partner team teams should also be  
facing relegation if they're not able to produce 
good results even if not every year then every two  
or three years cuz I also understand that it's 
a long process to sign an orc as partner orc or  
instead of one year R should be giving two years 
to Ascension teams in VCT and then the teams can  
extend their stay in VCT if they perform like 
you guys um I think the most Fair Way is for  
all teams to be able to face relegation but 
I know you know technicalities and stuff like  
that it doesn't really work like that um for 
us we were able to have a first year to just  
test the waters and get used to BCT luckily 
we were a good team and we were able to make  
it far um I would say if you're a good team 
from Ascension you have enough experience as  
a roster to go into VCT and you know win some 
games so I think it's fair for everyone I like  
the opportunity to be able to extend your stay 
and if you qualify for Champs you get to play  
again so that's pretty cool um there's a lot 
of questions like oh if you make it deep and  
you don't and you know maybe you even win 
Champions and you just go back to Ascension  
that kind of sucks but you you know that's 
out of the window now so I think rght made a  
good move on that I think it's still a pretty 
fair system um it is brutal but that that's  
the nature of competition right if you're a 
good team you stay if not you got to go back  
so I think it's okay thank you so much and good 
luck you we'll take the next question from Pedro
Romero P hello hello hello can you hear me yes 
all right perfect hey guys good to see yall in  
the press conference uh got a question for for 
Jing uh obviously looking at the story of this  
paper Squad it's basally different to the one 
that came so close to winning the whole thing  
last year of course you know with you returning 
to the squad you know having mon yet at the start  
of the year and then um gradually improving to 
this point qualifying for Champions that said my  
question to you is is uh in what way do you feel 
this version of the PRX Squad is different uh to  
last year's Squad you know sure you guys have the 
same Squad but still what is one thing that you  
feel is much more different this year to last 
year I feel like uh last year we had more time  
because like this year at the start they were 
practicing with mon yet and then I came in and  
there was really little time and this year the 
season is shorter as well so games are closer  
to each other so I feel like preparation 
time wise we have less compared to last  
year but I I still feel like we are still 
the same spot yeah I don't think much has
changed thank you we'll take the next question 
from Tong dang from Quang valerant uh hello  
uh have a good day everyone uh my I have two 
question for two player first of all is Mr Fallin  
from food uh what do you think about your new Lup 
performance in M Shanghai and VCT e em St one and  
two and and what going in the champion thank you 
so much and you going in Champion yeah yeah yeah  
our is I think better than the last year because 
we just they seen it like the 2021 champion and he  
has a lot of experience for us so we learn against 
how to play against the big teams like that  
I think we have good team better than last 
year because in this season in the kickoff  
you might miss but on shangai and on the EMA 
stages one and two I think we played as a good  
team than the other teams against EMA so we 
might maybe slip on the playoffs on the stage  
too but I think it doesn't matter because uh 
bestest Champions so we're going to give our  
best Champions right now that's all uh so my 
second question for valin from G2 esport uh  
what do you think about map abys and uh what 
will your team prepare for this champion thank  
you so much um I think the new map is pretty 
cool I think having Breeze come out and Abyss  
in it kind of is like a similar map because it's 
very wide it's very big the rotations are long  
for attack and defense so it kind of fills that 
void of missing Breeze um I think it's a funny  
map too because you know you can fall off and 
just die I think uh when I played against 100  
Thieves for um qualification game and booo just 
fell off the map one of the rounds I thought it  
was funny so it's a good mat thank you we'll 
take the next question from Tong Tong Billy
Billy for
so the question was before this champions in 
the stage two in CN you guys have a big you  
guys have a roster change and um as the first 
seat for seing League I'm sure that there a lot  
of pressure on your shoulder so tell us about 
your preparation for this Champs no matter on  
mentality or your game content and con's answer 
answer was that uh of course we prepared a lot  
even more on the game content and 
also including the Synergy and our  
comps and for mentality I would like 
to say we just going to try ourself  
and play our own thing nothing uh too 
big deal just going to you know try our
best thank you we'll take the next question from
Valeria hello everyone my question is to Jen 
uh throughout playoff and the break before the  
Champions did you guys get a chance to work on 
the expansion of your map Pool and also agent  
comp pool and also specific question is about 
the mentality I know that you've been working  
with the performance coach for a while can 
you share if there was already some positive  
experience and positive results thank you I think 
yes for both questions yes definitely like even  
if we have a really good Maple you can always 
improve so we're always practicing and trying  
to get better at every map and for performance 
coach wise I think yeah definitely I think after  
taking like big losses and stuff people can be 
really sad and stuff so the performance coach  
definitely helps our mentality in like resetting 
and just focusing on what's coming up next thank  
you and one more question real quick Asus 
today earlier mentions that he wants to go  
one-on-one against J uh because he likes you uh 
any words in response to that I mean hopefully  
I play against aspas again I've only played 
against him I think once and he was in Champs  
last year so maybe this time we can meet again 
thank you thank you thank you we'll go next to
raish Sure uh hey guys what's up uh so 
my question is for valin uh first hey hey  
what's up man you good uh uh real quick man so 
first and foremost Mass congrats on winning of  
course igl and control of the years to two 
Master dos back toback giving over on VCT  
right now we talked a long time ago about you 
playing like you have a chip on your shoulder  
and you got a lot to prove do you think finally 
you've been given the respect you deserve or is  
this still more that you got to let people know um 
I think you know it feels good to make champions  
and um be selected for awards it feels nice 
but we haven't won anything big yet to be  
honest we haven't won a stage we haven't won 
a masters so there's nothing for me to feel  
like um too happy about you know I still have 
a lot to prove as an individual and for my team  
so we're just going to come out here and do our 
best and hopefully you know we can finally lift  
a trophy that would be really cool right thanks 
man appreciate it thank you we'll take the next  
question from Alan yeah thank you uh so this is 
question for Kang uh I I'll speak English first  
so this uh this is part of two part questions 
so for the first part about the New Jersey  
looks really different and uh what what what 
is your thought about New your New Jersey and  
uh the second part is uh we all know that uh 
you know during last year's Champions 2023 uh  
edj is really or should we say in the whole year 
of 2023 EDG is showing a great great performance  
you got your first wing and a very good uh you 
know rank in the two uh um International Event  
uh for this year how do you feel that your 
you and your team are currently at compared  
to last year and especially uh maybe in the 
background of the global competition hello K uh
oh
okay
[Music]
for
uh for
okay so the answer from is actually uh generally 
he he likes the New Jersey and uh there is some  
special design on it uh even though there is 
some part of it is it doesn't really understand  
and the second uh part of the question is his 
answer is uh he actually thinks that everyone  
coming into this event wants to win wants 
to win it all of course and uh uh but for  
he and his team for EDG they come into this event 
and they feel like they are less like feeling like  
an underdog compared to last year because last 
year they were feeling like they uh they were  
maybe they are not competitive enough in in the 
all 16 teams but now they feels like they we are  
all have a equal chance in this tournament 
and they would really want to just uh show  
their best so show their best effort during 
this event thank you so more than that that  
con J said that about the design of their New 
Jersey the black things on their right should  
right shoulder feel a little bit weird and the 
stick the Red Stick he doesn't really understand  
that because when the wind is too big just to 
blowing his space and for the second question  
he just said that he thinks the most important 
things is about the process uh the the process  
no matter is difficult or easy for the team the 
most important things is to you know play their  
own SC and try their best in the game and this 
year they feel like everybody seems like they  
will treat every team at the same and treat 
think they are maybe at the same level with  
the other teams so that's all thank you thank you 
we'll take the next question from one plus Olivia
uh
[Music]
uh
[Music]
so the first question
oh oh okay so the first question was that um we 
know that adj have change your changed your igl  
so do you think you guys have Corporation 
better than before and what's your go  
and expectation for this Champions and K's answer 
is that it feels like it's just about the um IG  
eling style between nobody and how and if you 
want to talking about our expectation for these  
champions of course we want to win and I also 
talked uh have said that before uh said that  
before this is the first International Tournament 
for Simon and I just wanted to um let him to know  
that how to enjoy the stage and how to have fun 
and play your own thing on the stage and second  
question is that at this time you have been 
the same group with PRX again and you guys  
have faced against each other so many times in the 
International Tournament so what do you think uh  
it will be if you guys have faced against to each 
other in this group stage and K's answer was that  
he doesn't really know if they going to meet 
because there will be one team that they won't  
meet in the group but he still really looking 
forward if they have a chance to face against  
with PRX that's all thank you okay sorry one 
more one more question for JE uh no we have to  
no we have to go to a different reporter thank 
you okay thank you we'll go next to Brandon at
Esports thank you very much um I'll ask this to 
Jing um you know last year we saw your emotions  
I was there you know when you guys got second at 
Champions you know not knowing you know when you'd  
be back with the team this year there's a lot of 
talk about uh Pacific you know winning their first  
you know Masters event and it went to gen instead 
of you know paper rex or DRX who many expected it  
to be do you feel like there's a pressure that's 
kind of lifted off your shoulders now that you  
guys don't have to be the first from your region 
to win uh you know an International Tournament and  
now you can just kind of relax and and go through 
Champions on your own and try to win that I think  
for us we didn't really put like pressure on 
ourselves to be the first team to win but now that  
geni has won I guess it just shows that pacific 
is not really like dead week of a region so I  
mean that probably just pushes us to work even 
harder and want to win for Pacific the second
trophy thank you um and unfortunately this will 
be our last question of the press conference um  
Sierra uh would you like to close us out yeah 
of course uh my question is for Valen so in  
one of the earlier press conference groups they 
talked about the consistency of careers in VCT  
for players like Mako boster and kzn how do you 
think your unique experience of once competing in  
VCT back with a guard and then having to battle 
back through Ascension has affected how you have  
developed as a player maybe how the G2 Corp has 
developed as a team especially since you've now  
kind of reached a new peak of qualifying 
for Champions uh yeah it was definitely a  
long journey to get to this point um my first 
big showing in VCT was back in 2021 I believe  
where or 2022 when we qualified for raiki viic 
and um from there you know we didn't make the  
partnership league so we had to climb our way back 
up um into into VCT and so I think I learned a lot  
of about my team we experienced a lot of different 
things you know going from international events to  
just playing Ascension online um all year and 
then you know getting Redemption and land when  
we went to Brazil going into this year I think 
I think we had um pretty high expectations of  
ourselves just because we are all hungry players 
you know we we want to show that we can be one of  
the best and we had a successful year um so I'm 
happy about that uh going to two International  
lens this year I feel like I've gained a lot of 
experience and so with that I'm just going to uh  
apply it learn as much as I can and hopefully 
come out with more wins and hopefully have  
a consistent and successful career like some of 
the other players you mentioned thank you so much  
Valen Jing uh K Kang Mr Fallen thank 
you so much for taking the time to  
speak with us today this will conclude 
the pre-event press conference uh and  
we'll be back tomorrow with more interviews and 
postmatch conferences thank you and good night
