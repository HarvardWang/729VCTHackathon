we are joined by team Heretics who are coming 
off of their Victory uh against EDG please use  
the zoom handra function if you would like to ask 
a question and we will call on you we'll begin  
with strafe hi guys first of all I'd like to say 
it was a great match for you guys congratulations  
on the win so now I it's a two-part question from 
my side so first of all U you the match against  
EDG was actually very dominant from your side so 
do you think that you were the better team do you  
had the better strats or do you feel like that 
EDG just didn't show up show up for the match for  
the match and also the second question is that 
now you've faced all the Chinese teams in the  
tournament and you've and you've managed to beat 
them all on home turf so how does that make you  
feel and how is the confidence going forward this 
question is open for everyone first question you  
want answer I the second one you um I don't think 
they did up I think we had insane preparation um I  
think every already played well like the rounds 
that we lost for the rounds where we made some  
misplays in my opinion so like we played really 
well and the rounds where we played well like they  
had no chance so to to preparation and was playing 
well and I think every single time I gave them  
something they won around so like they were there 
100% so to answer your question I think we were  
the better team and they've still amazing team I 
can answer the other one U about us playing all  
three Chinese teams I think all of us are pretty 
happy that you know we got to experience playing  
you know a different region other than EMA you 
know it's always nice you know when the draw was  
happening I think it was between fnatic and yeah 
fnatic and EDG um and we were super happy that EDG  
got to pick us just because we didn't want to have 
to play fnatic again like we've played them so  
many times in the NBA um I think playing against 
them is super interesting you know got a different  
play style they go off meta um especially like fpx 
so I'm interested you know in the way they play I  
think it's quite cool and I think in general we 
like teams that you know innovate and they're  
very Innovative Innovative so yeah no it was it 
was a lot of fun all right thank you thank you  
thank you we'll go next to sports K yes uh first 
of all congratulations on the win today uh my  
question is this it's like somewhat similar 
to the second part of the previous question  
and it's to you Benji fishy uh so you faced 
all the three you faced all the three Chinese  
teams now yet today's series was the one where you 
looked the most dominant yet so do you think the  
matches against fpx and drg sort of contributed 
towards achieving such a landslide Victory today  
uh yeah 100% I mean before a game against dog 
we had one game of practice or sorry one day of  
practice um and I think you know as the tournament 
went on we've become you know just better um and  
you know since we qualified to play we got a few 
days off uh where we could have where we prepared  
and I think that's why we were so dominant in this 
game we just we had time to prepare um which we  
didn't have you know against really drg or fpx 
um I think if we were more prepared against the  
OJ and fpx we would have had an easier time um 
yeah I think you know now that we've had time I  
think we we kind of showed how good we actually 
can be thank you thank you thanks uh we'll go  
back to straight for the next question so this 
question is for the coach so your next match is  
against G2 and uh G2 managed to upset PRX today 
like they were The Underdogs and noas and they  
clearly upset PRX so what are your expectations 
going into that matchup and do you feel confident  
that you'll be able to take like beat G2 in that 
match yeah I think uh We've mentioned it a little  
bit before but I think we felt quite um obviously 
like when we played them before we played really  
well on notice um they completely outplayed us on 
B to be honest they're a very very strong team um  
and then on split it kind of felt like we let them 
win like we played really poor fundamentally and  
that's not really like us so now that we've had a 
bit more time to prepare like the guys have said  
we're feeling a lot more confident um but I think 
in general like G2 are just a strong team and I'm  
actually not surprised that they managed to upset 
papx I think g2's play style how they play quite  
slow um they've got the players and they've 
got the kind of play style to capitalize on  
on pex's aggression so yeah like I mean again PX 
are an incredible team and I think a lot of people  
expected them to win so fact that G2 them is uh 
impressive but yeah I think everyone's really  
excited just to show a better better version 
of ourselves than what we did the last time  
we played G2 so yeah we're we're happy all right 
thank you thank you we'll go to Pedro Romero next
hey guys uh likewise congrats on the W progressing 
to the up bre semi great job on that I got a  
question for anyone to ask more so as we all know 
mini Boo's not in with you guys in Shanghai but  
he is supporting you guys in spirit and you know 
of course I'm sure you know that he's been kind  
of co- streaming observing your games and just uh 
supporting you guys I just want to know like uh  
how is how have you you you know his support 
and his presence in spirit and just having  
to continue playing continue competing while 
also doing it in a way that U you're doing it  
for him as well you know on top of just doing 
it to to win and as you should answer yeah so  
like we all appreciate minibus like effort for 
us like while streaming anything and we we're  
not only playing for mini I want to say about 
something Weber as well so he's not with us  
here so we we play for Brandon Weber and Mini at 
the same time so like we all miss both of them but  
they're not here but you know is what it is so 
we just play for them we love them that's it I  
also add one thing to that as well like Ina said 
is very true that we're playing for mini Boo for  
Weber but also like in my opinion for Patty like 
I'm so happy that Patty gets the chance to show  
himself on the bigger stage again um and the way 
performed in the last couple of games has been  
like absolutely incredible so you know that was 
another big thing about getting Patty back like  
it was to show everyone what he can do and like 
I don't know bro if he doesn't get a chance in a  
tier one team now like I don't know what's going 
on I think uh we've built a pretty good roster  
this season I can safely say that so take it from 
our talance c that P is [ __ ] incredible and he  
deserves to be on a tier one team so yeah what he 
contributes to this team it really really helps uh  
the Gap that mini Buu is leaving right now you 
know so yeah that is a legend I want to mention  
one more thing as well also like um all the people 
like that are on our side like in I we've got  
Pablo you know anti our analyst uh we've got Mo 
like our Chef Abby like there's a lot of people  
that we you know we couldn't bring to Shanghai 
so yeah we're just doing it for all of them howy  
what went to your head when you got called up can 
you walk us through that a little bit um on the  
positive feelings I mean Neil know me for what 
for like four and a half years already like uh  
the first time we met was like back in 2020 with 
the g2 roster and uh we had a really good contact  
there but unfortunately there was some missteps 
in the orc which uh costed us to part ways but  
I'm really happy to get the chance to play on 
International stages and like this team is insane  
and the coaching staff and everyone behind it like 
should get the recognition they are getting and  
yeah it's just amazing that Neil thinks that way 
thank you we'll go to stra Fe Sports next um this  
question is again open to all the players and the 
coach so both the wins from today's matchups came  
from the teams that played through the Swiss 
stage of the tournament so do you think that  
having that experience in under your belt actually 
helps in these playoff matches as compared to  
other teams which which had to call start straight 
from the playoffs yes 100% I think experience and  
playing experience of the Swiss stage playing on 
stage is more impactful than the fact that you can  
anti your opponents like for example adg they 
could P games and they could like PR something  
but I think on the stage we were more ready more 
present so I think it's better than being the you  
know the number one seat from the region all right 
thank you very much and all the best for your  
upcoming match up thank you thank you uh and we'll 
take the last question from remote media from
Pedro another question again to the rest to to 
everyone who would like to answer you know of  
course looking at the team's trajectory earlier 
on in the year you guys weren't able to uh win a  
single match in Madrid but now you guys are are 
top six at the very least winning against all of  
China and also impressing against or impressing 
everyone in the process um when you compare how  
the team performed from that stage to now um what 
do you think is the what's the biggest difference  
that just sparked everything to go right go okay 
so basically in Masters Madrid I'm not gonna lie  
we had like really really strong opponents which 
is like Sentinels and paper uh like Sentinels has  
won the tournament and paper Rex were top three 
I guess uh but I'm going to be honest like in  
this tournament we had like I don't know worse 
opponents like worse than the like worse compared  
to Sentinel and paper Rex so also getting like 
first win Hypes you as a team I think it Hypes  
everyone qualifying for playoffs also like spark 
everything in the team you know so yeah I can  
answer that I think as well one thing OD that 
like uh Masters Madrid was like the first time  
on stage for almost all of our boys like on an 
international level uh so that was like a huge  
learning curve you know like in I said we played 
two really really strong teams it was very close  
games and we managed to learn quite a lot from 
those ones uh so it was like invaluable experience  
so I think it's just a combination of river like 
K I said as well we had you know we didn't have to  
play perx and Sentinels in our first two games so 
yeah it definitely helped us build some confidence
uh any questions from the
room Heretics thank you so much for 
taking the time to speak with us
