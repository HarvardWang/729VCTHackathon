uh hello everyone thank you for joining us today 
for this press conference uh we are to to have  
uh the teams here to share their thoughts and 
experience from today's match my name is Juan  
Moreno and I will be guiding us through today's 
proceedings we have a packet agenda so let's get  
start first I'd like to introduce paper workx uh 
thank you guys for being here and congratulations  
your lost uh so we are going to start with 
uh some question that the media has on online  
please raise your hand uh I will call on you 
when is your turn so we will starting with uh  
strafe e for K madani hi uh thank you first 
of all I'd like to say to you guys sorry for  
the loss uh so my question is for Alex so you 
know the team look really Scrappy on both the  
maps in this series so what do you think 
actually went wrong or where were some of  
the points that you could improve and also a 
follow-up question how do you think you can  
work on these mistakes and what are the things 
you think you need to improve for your next
series I think well maybe we can go my but I think 
icebox we just had a game plan and we went away  
from it and because of that I think it was a bit 
more difficult for us and also I mean firstly G2  
is really really good you know like it's very 
rare we play a team that like well maybe it's  
not rare but like they hard to play against you 
know so sometimes we just if we plan wrongly you  
know and we we can't hit our shots because we in 
the wrong positions it gets really hard and you  
know their masters are pushing you away from your 
composition I'm really good at utility basically  
so just one gecko flash gets all of us because 
they combine it very well it's really Troublesome  
for us um on Lotus I think we just didn't play 
our cop well on attack you know defense is okay  
I think if we start on defense that's my fault I 
think we probably should have started on defense  
um I think we maybe maybe if we get the lead 
instead you know may have been a different
story oh thank you so much uh next question is 
from Valeria hello guys considerations on your  
loss um it's kind of uncomfortable I can hear 
myself uh sorry uh my question is to Coach Alex  
um so when I was watching my can I yeah
sorry oh yes when I was watching Bank pick uh I 
think that it went pretty favorable for your team  
correct me if I'm wrong uh as for your opponent I 
feel like G2 might be stylistically not the most  
comfortable opponent for you with a approach and 
heavy use of you uh what do you think about it  
and maybe you can add something on top of that 
thank you yeah I thought I thought the veto went  
be okay for us map that we like to play and yeah 
we know we know we know that G2 is difficult play  
against I think we we've had trouble with their 
particular STS particularly only need them I  
think they they play like this um we're still 
trying to find a solution as you can see today  
go the way we plan okay thank you I'm pretty sure 
you can bounce back and good luck in the next
round thank you so much next question is 
from fundo thank you for the time paper  
wrex I would like to ask H what do you 
think H the team needed to do in iceo to  
have a better performance against G2 since it 
was a close matchup until the fs the F house
in general
just okay uh
I I think um we had some protocols that we could 
have done better I think we yeah you know it came  
down to preparation I think and we didn't we 
didn't like follow our preparation as well as  
we can I think we tried to we tried to elevate a 
little bit and it went wrong um we could have gone  
b a lot more I think we prepared a lot for B and 
we didn't go B so it's a bit strange on our end we  
were a bit obsessed with trying to hit the a bomb 
site and you know have really good defense there  
all right thank you so much okay we have uh time 
for more questions uh remember please raise your  
hand and we we'll call you so uh next question 
is from stfe hi thank you so this question is  
open to anyone on the table so uh online there 
have been quite a few posts which I've seen which  
say that G2 were actually better suited for this 
matchup against PRX so do you have any like their  
play style was better suited against yours so 
would you agree with this sentiment do you think  
that this is wrong and is there any comments 
that you guys would like to add onto it as
well guess we agree uh I mean they play 
really well regardless of play St you play  
really really well I think you're going to 
have a very good very good game regardless
um I think we should have done better 
but I don't think he came down down to  
play style you know we were trying to 
we trying to do different things and  
it still didn't work so comes 
down to just them being better
today all right thank you and 
all the best for your upcoming  
match up thank you thank you and next question is
from hey guys likewise commiserations on the 
LW got a question for forsaken obviously as  
every everybody knows this is not the first 
time you guys face off against G2 last time  
being in Shanghai that said um how do you 
kind of look at the state of this team your  
team uh between that time uh back in Shanghai 
a few months ago and now um how how you how  
you come how do you kind of make that confir 
comparison in terms of form and just put state  
of the team um I mean last time in Shanghai I 
think we have so much problem in Shanghai uh  
um but this time we are I think as a team 
when I see my team I think um like we're  
ined together but maybe today we just first 
match you know like nerfa or whatever and  
we we do a lot of mistakes but I will say in 
Shanghai it's not like family but now I think  
we're more like family now but I still 
believe I think we can lower breaket run
cool thank you so much uh so thank 
you paper Rex for your insights H  
for being here today your determination 
and sportmanship are commendable we look  
forward to seeing your future matches 
and Su thank you very much thank you
