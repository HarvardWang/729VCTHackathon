okay welcome back everyone uh for the next 
segment we have uh G2 the winning team uh  
congratulations guys for your Victory 
uh we are going to start uh with some  
question from the uh journalist online 
so we open the floor the question from  
the media please raise your hand and I will 
call on you when asking your question please  
state your name and the outlet J that you 
represent we are going to start with Brandon
awesome thank you very much congratulations on the  
win guys I will send this to 
Jonah P I'm Brandon Moore with
esports.com cost him the match or did 
you guys you know just outplay them
today I think both they got better 
but we just were better we just you  
know it was a two- this time instead of 
2-1 um sorry was a second part to that
question yeah just if uh you know I asked if you 
personally felt they they played better or if you  
felt they did choke or you know if you guys just 
outplayed them you know in general yeah I think  
we just outclassed them I don't think we ever 
gave them an opportunity for them to choke I  
think we were just in control of the whole 
game so um we had the opportunity to choke  
but we didn't so so yeah it was a great game 
oh thank you so much uh next question is from
fundo and thank you for for the 
time G2 and congratulations for  
your win today h well here vundo for 
FD news I will ask I would like to  
ask some two questions it was difficult 
to close the result in lotos to win the
series uh for generally yes wait what was can you 
repeat it sorry yes after the match point it was  
difficult to close the the resting Lotus yeah it 
was getting difficult for us because um I think we  
just got not nervous but we were getting an like 
anxious in our plays uh we weren't you know being  
decisive we weren't like making plans we were 
kind of letting them make the plans and reacting  
to them instead of taking control of the game so 
I'd say that's why it started to get pretty close  
H thank you and the last question is what do you 
think was necessary to change for that to happen
tactical pause I I just had to remind them like 
hey guys let's uh keep getting more map control  
let's be decisive on on when we take up take the 
opportunities um and just like just take the site  
and start finding finding uh finding for areas so 
once we did that and we got control of the game we  
were able to close it and icy oh yeah IC too all 
right thank you thank you so much for the for the  
okay next question is from
Pomo hey guys uh uh again congrats on the 
victory I got a question for Joon and P the  
shirt what does that say on your shirt you 
know what's the translation and why do I see  
I think a bottle of milk or something I need 
a correction on that so what what what does  
the shirt say um well basically it's like 
just popular things to do in Korea and like  
the shirt says um things you need to do 
or Buy in Korea and it's just you know  
the food the banana milk uh get you know 
get the trophy and of course buy the G2  
classic so make sure you get yours and buy 
the shirt please please but you should just
buy thank so much uh next question is from Anton
Su thank you so much my question for bing bing we 
know you have experience at the Master Level but  
this is your first year since you asent to the 
franchises with the card it's been an excellent  
year and in your deot season you made it all 
the way to the Champions something something not  
everyone achieves how do you feel about such an 
amazing year yeah I mean it's hard to appreciate  
the journey especially when you're in the moment 
of competing but if I'm able to reflect like right  
now um I would say the year has been amazing and 
I'm doing it with the guys that I love playing  
with the most um it was a rough year at the 
beginning you know it we weren't having the best  
results um we were choking a lot of maps and we're 
kind of at the bottom of the pack but once we kind  
of refix uh we got our identity back um we had to 
make a roster move and ever since then I think the  
hard work and dedication that all of these players 
and coaches put into the team is unmatched and  
that's why we get the results we get so it feels 
amazing to get these results but anything else  
would have been a disappointment considered how 
much effort we put into this year and so I'm very  
happy to Showcase to my team mainly that you 
know hard work and dedication no matter what  
happens can lead to great things and it kind of 
proves that no matter who you are no matter how  
much experience you have if you work hard you 
can um achieve whatever so it's a great year um  
and hopefully we can have an even greater ending 
thank you so much thanks next question is from
sidart hello guys this is s from Sports kir 
congrats on the win today and I'd like to ask  
this question to Valen uh papx over the years it's 
been common opinion that they a very tough team to  
go against largely because of their volatile play 
style and how unpredictable they can be but in  
both occasions G2 played against them it's been 
like a very convincing win largely due to a lot  
of anti statting and you know just clean game play 
and count during the W gaming uh so do you without  
revealing too much would you say it's because of 
the team's like uh protocols and structure or is  
it just like good calling and what makes you guys 
have such an easy time against papx when you look  
at play Styles I think paperex is known to be one 
of you know some of the best aimers out of APAC  
they take a lot of aggressive fights aggressive 
DUS and they try to put the pressure on you that  
way and then when you look at G2 we're a team 
that thrives off our discipline we never give  
you a fair fight you know it's always a saying 
in our team like we want them to Peak and see  
three people not one so I think that's a bit of 
a counter to how they approach the game and if  
we're able to maintain that discipline and play 
to our standard you know in theory we should be  
able to beat them every time because they're 
a bit more aggressive and they take a bit more  
risks while we're a little bit more conservative 
and we punish those kind of plays and if they  
were to kind of flip the switch we're also ready 
for the next step so we're very deep team and it  
just comes down to the boys feeling comfy on 
the stage and having the discipline that day  
all right thank you so much for your answer and 
good luck to the next game thank you thank you  
next question is from Pedro Romero yeah 
I got another question again to to Jonah  
p i mean looking at the entire series 
uh given the things has been said about  
the team's um overall form and uh um format 
or kind of um how they play against PRX um  
you kind of played well in individually speaking 
and also the same can be said for the rest of the  
team but focusing on yourself you know there's 
plenty of times where you your positioning was  
was excellent and you were able to pick off you 
know different players of PRX at different times  
of the series that said I want to ask you about 
how you kind of look at your form and and the  
Improvement you saw you know gradually speaking 
as the series played out and in addition to that  
kind of worked well for you amidst you know this 
C this countering aspect of you guys over PRX um  
well I think a big reason why I'm like you know 
my form is is getting better than it normally is  
is to my teammates especially on Lotus like you 
talked about my positioning it's just all the the  
Reps and practice we have as a team like I know 
what my teammates are capable of and I know what  
I have to do to fill in the gaps and you know if 
I have my team at a I know like I trust them the  
whole day and I'll just stay on beat for in case 
they want to you know pivot away because if I saw  
valon icy and Trent on a site I'm pivoting B too 
I'm I'm out of there so I'm just going to fill  
fill that space and you know I get the easiest 
kill so it's not really my form it's just like  
it's just game knowledge and understanding um 
what my teammates have and know I capitalize on
it thank you so much uh that was the last question 
so thank you you to uh for sharing your thoughts  
and experience congratulations once again for your 
Victory thank you thank you thank you thank you
