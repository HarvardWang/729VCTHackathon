that the team applied in securing today's
win every now and then you know we we play 
like that you know I mean not not not to  
not to say that G2 didn't play extremely 
well they did but uh sometimes you know  
we just lose our minds a bit and then weing 
the game really hard uh it was maybe a long  
overd talk again you know every time we lose 
you know we we just get together and we talk  
and then we try and figure it out and I think we 
came to the conclusion that we I mean wrong game  
plan you know more anything else everybody's 
mind was a bit clattered it was a bit it was a  
we knew it was going to be a extremely difficult 
game and we made it harder for ourselves so this  
what today we wanted to try and relax a little bit 
better before playing the game okay thank you so

is for Coach Alex uh you changed the bind call 
comp and it was a turnaround of one day first of  
all was it difficult to change comp overnight

where every player has like one chance  
to change the com just before game and today
