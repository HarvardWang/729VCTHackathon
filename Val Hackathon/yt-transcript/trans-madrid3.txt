all right hello everyone welcome to the press 
conference we are joined by preper Rex who are  
coming off with a victory against Carmine Corp we 
are going to start with a written question first  
uh this question goes to manette from Sports 
K to Esports you looked a lot more confident  
today than your previous matches was this the 
result of yesterday's match or were there some  
other factors that got you fired up from the 
start of the series I'll would say more like  
a my teammate like really trust me you know so it 
built the confidence like even more this this day  
so yeah thank you we'll now move to remote 
media questions if you have a question for  
the team please use a zoom Henry's feature first 
question goes to strafe Esports hi guys first of  
all I would like to say that congrats on the win 
so this question is for the coach so your match  
in the playoffs is against the Gen G so how 
do you feel about this Revenge match up what  
are your plans and what are your expectations 
for this first match in the playoffs I mean  
no expectations I think uh we're just trying 
to take it step by step I think happy to play  
anyone more than anything we're happy to be in 
the playoffs um as usual we're just going to  
try our best and try and use this opportunity 
to make sure that we're ready for the rest of  
the season thank you next question sorry chaku 
and hello guys I'm shaku from T first for all  
congratulate for the win and qualific for 
playoffs and I have the two questions the  
first question is for Alex about the new Lotus 
composition what is the reason for ring asra  
in instead of Viper and why didn't they shows 
to theen to M like an agent he is comfortable
with I mean okay look so what we did with um 
split was we changed uh monia to Omen right  
but the result of that is four people have to 
change their roles you know and that's usually  
not easy with very little time um the Lotus 
this time we have even less time and to get  
four people to change their roles on a map 
that's as complicated as L is probably going  
to be worse than what you saw just now um so 
the reason we change com is because you know  
like we struggling on the map I think we have 
the last two losses were quite bad and we kind  
of figure out how to fix it so I mean this is a 
h m we knew that KC was going to pick Lotus just  
did what we could to like throw them off you know 
because if we I think if we went without original  
com I don't think I think we made no to be honest 
okay and my second question is for Monette H you  
have improved a lot your performance with race thr 
out a tournament do you think it H has been good  
for you play more different Ro or why you repeat 
the question why you improve as you know sorry  
sorry I repeat just confidence I guess the the 
confidence is buil up and now like I'm so just  
a little bit more comfortable on calling where 
I want to go where I want what I want to do so  
yeah okay uh thank you and good luck in the play 
Ops thank you very much thank you hello guys here  
T from sons of Kes from Latin America first of 
all congratulations on your win my question is  
both for Alex and forsen you're going to face J 
again really soon uh what do you have to say to  
the Korean team now that you're facing them again 
and what do you think that could be different this
time I mean I just want to tell them one of us 
got to win this tournament man it's been a while  
um I think you know we're friends with everyone 
in Pacific it's nice to see familiar faces across  
um even if you're in EU uh we hope this time we 
manage to shut texture down beat up car on try  
our best uh I think they really manhandle us last 
final so we I'm hoping that we uh we get it right  
this time yeah I mean we don't really expect 
anything we just play our game I would say for  
the playoff L and yeah no matter how no matter 
who we we just like play each other with the  
team and uh the last one is also for Alex uh were 
you expecting uh the Masters Madrid like the the  
last um run of the of the tournament to be just 
Pacific and America team oh of course not I mean  
I even think we'll be here I mean truth be told 
like we haven't been in good shape you know and  
we've been struggling so it seems that these type 
matches we not the best in US um and um I mean you  
know look I mean they they're so close to winning 
you know like uh some kind of miracle that we won  
and I we're just going to have to try and bounce 
with the energy and see what we can do in playoffs  
thank you congratulations against for your win 
and good luck on playf thank you next question  
from arnab hi guys congratulations on the win uh 
thank you my question is uh open for everyone uh  
given that you guys have a day break before the 
playoffs how do you guys uh like prepare for  
the upcoming game given that you have already 
played ji and they know your play style you  
are familiar with their play style so what what's 
the usual like game plan or something that uh you
follow
um I guess um I shall not sure I haven't 
really thought about it um the usual thing  
to do would be to just watch all their games 
you know and then see what and guess try and  
guess their adjustments you know um change 
com change some new plans bring some old  
ones back you know try to try to refine 
our game in the in the next two days and  
then uh from there you know like just play the 
game and see how it works it's usually what we
do thank you next question from
Pedro hey guys likewise congrats on the win 
and progress into playoffs I got a question  
for forsaken but anyone else can um chime in if 
they want um during the the series obviously you  
guys were uh on the uh had a deficit you know 
losing to to to to carine Court in lotos and  
then falling behind at the end of the first half 
in a sent I just want to know like what kind of  
cost that you guys to suddenly make that turn 
in the second half on defensive side and just  
subsequently win the series um in overtime you 
know how did that happen uh from your perspective  
um I guess I think the key factor is like like no 
matter like what the score is we just like try to  
like believe each other you know and then we try 
to like keep the mood happy and then we just like  
try to play the game as usual like how we play on 
practice so I think we just like at that moment I  
I think can't believe that we manage to come back 
but I would say it's really good that we come back
yeah thank you next question from 
strafe Esports this question is
for this question is for Monet so last time we 
talk you said that the dualist role that you now  
switching between controller and dualist it was 
your call so now we've seen you playing up to  
your potential and you look quite good on it so 
I want to ask how how confident do you feel now  
and how do you feel going into the playoffs 
like what are your expectations still 50 or  
60% I think it's not like that confident 
as what I play on controller last year
though and your expectations uh you'll see I don't 
want to jinx no expectations no expectation zero  
expectation okay thank you thank you next 
question from Fernando valeron uh thank you  
this is my name is Fernando I'm from valone from 
Brazil my question is for Alex and Alex I want  
to know from you how important is forsaken's 
role on this team since he played every role  
on this tournament I mean I think you've all 
seen it before like um Jason for is the guy  
that makes things work for us he he creates a 
lot of the plans you know a lot of ideas come  
from p and the rest of us just bounce ideas 
he he tends to just bounce ideas off all the  
players you know and and and we feeled off this 
kind of energy to make sure that we like get get  
through practice um because of that you know 
he's he is the integral part of our team and  
our I mean he doesn't want to say he do you want 
to be Captain Jason okay so he's not our captain  
but uh Captain isap but uh but uh yeah so like he 
it revolves around him you know so like I mean he  
he enjoys the pressure enjoys the creativity and 
something that we really really Val bre he one  
of my most important players okay thank you very 
much good luck in the rest of the tournament thank  
you next question from sports key to Esports 
hello uh first of all congratulations on the  
win that was a very entertaining match lot of ups 
and downs and that was stressful to watch uh my  
question is for forsaken uh you've played a total 
of six agents in the S stage so far and cooked up  
a lot of unique team compositions which agent has 
been the most fun or was your favorite to play and
why um race only on split it was a good 
um race debut you know so yeah I mean  
I haven't playo for this tournament right I 
think you lost no no no no never we already  
switch race or Harbor yeah uh no because I don't 
I haven't play in this tournament oh yeah we play
yeah thank you so much and all the best for 
the playoff matches thank you next question  
from periodista gamer thank you um first of 
all guys congrats on the win thank you um  
this is for daai daai paper WX always makes 
it to this final stage what do you think the  
team has learned from past experience to win this 
Masters nothing nothing I mean if you look at the  
game just now we threw a lot of easy rounds you 
know I guess we learn nothing I mean we try but  
I think we never give up though but I guess our 
Mentor is good you know maybe there is something  
that we always tell ourself that doesn't matter 
if the rounds goes to the downhill but we keep  
telling ourself that yeah it's okay guys we can 
always come back from this you know like we did  
this before and yeah it's not impossible 
you know so I guess our mental strength is  
one of the biggest factor in our team instead 
of discipline you know I think that's what we  
are good at got mental yeah I think we got good 
six times four or five six nothing new bro that
one thank you next question question from
Pedro got a question for for something um we've 
seen you play the get-go and this 11th time  
since going back to the off season I just want to 
know like your thoughts on just the agent how you  
have fit into to to the agent and your performance 
with the agent um just now recently against Carman
cor I would say I like to play on geeko 
is a really fun agent and uh I can play  
on op also on this agent and the 
low key I want to play on bridge  
but there's no fracture no powerful for 
example and no heaven so yeah I like to
play thank you next question from strafe Esports 
this question is for the players so on asent you  
guys had a bit of a shaky start but then 
the time out was called and then you guys  
made quite a recovery although the match went 
into overtime you still pulled out both the  
rounds on overtime so I want to know how you 
guys managed to adapt to what Casey was doing  
and what instructions or what motivation did the 
coach give you in that timeout so that you could  
make that recovery possible answer again go I 
think for this matches I think we have to give  
B props to Alex I think he's been calling all of 
the things that Casey going to do to us like most  
of the tech H by us and casy Alex kind of like 
figure out like what they're going to do you  
know so yeah I think we won especially on Lotus 
and Asen he had pretty much good read on them you
know next question from Arnold uh my question 
is for something uh this is uh a long debate uh  
have been like going on since valent has been 
released that op is not viable on agents apart  
from D but looking at you and and Performing 
using op on Geo has been phenomenal but uh  
do you still think it's an issue to use an OP 
another agent other than J train or something  
like this I'll say it depends on how you're 
playing in your team because uh you know our  
team for example usually we play double du right 
and uh for example I can go first Sometimes I can  
go to another uh another map I would say and just 
play for my with my op and try to get kill and uh  
for example in this on this map uh I play a lot 
with up because first of all they don't don't  
have Sentinels and uh also we have a big gap on 
the middle especially when we have difference  
and uh yeah just at this game I just have big 
confidence to pick everything on the middle and  
it's only the chance we can win this game when 
I cut rotation and uh do something on middle  
I cannot play for example retake because they 
have really strong comp to go to the side yeah  
thank you everyone and best of luck for playoffs 
thank you are there any question questions in the
room all right well that concludes 
our press conference with paper Rex
congratulations
