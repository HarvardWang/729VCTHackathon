okay uh hello everyone uh thank you for joining 
us today for this press conference uh we have a  
packet agenda so let us start first I would like 
to introduce uh gtu uh guys thank you for being  
here I know it's not a good moment for you but 
thank you for here and joining us today so we  
now open the floor question from the media uh 
please raise your hand and I will call on you
okay we have our first question is from Andres 
uh hi good morning good afternoon good night  
ER I have a question for for Josh how is how you 
think this comp for for AIS this joru this sastra  
what is all the work behind that what is the 
logic behind it yes the the logic behind that  
comp um without getting into too many details 
of course um basically pick agents that bit the  
map and what it requires us to do um so easy one 
is yoru and with a map that large you definitely  
want to have like faster rotates and have the 
ability also dive at the same time support  
flashes so that's um that's an example of like 
why I would pick a euru that thank you so much
okay uh next question is from s hello sier here my 
question is also for Josh um you said in the mid  
series interview uh that you were confident but 
in in your preparation on Abyss but understanding  
that it was a risk and clearly it didn't go as 
as you had hop so I'm wondering where you think  
maybe the preparation or uh the practice fell 
short maybe for how you guys wanted to perform  
on that map picking into it today yeah it 
definitely fell short of expectations and  
and I still think we're confident on that map 
um it's one of those like we're we're a little  
bit nervous we forgot certain certain uh wi 
conditions that need to happen for us to make  
that comp work um and then before we adjusted it 
was a little too late on getting enough rounds on  
attack um and not having that buffer going to 
defense where the attack side has such an easy  
time just farming ultimates you definitely 
are on the back foot so if since we got four  
rounds like that was like very uphill battle 
for us if we if was reversed then um I think  
you'll see a much different score line Thank 
you thank you uh next question is from Antonio
summer thank you so much for my question 
hi I am Su from nerud and my question is  
for Bing I think we all want to know exactly 
why you jump it into the void but my question  
is more focused on why do it in the first 
seconds of the around and not force the  
enemy's utility to deplete their economy uh 
so they don't get all orbs we don't want to  
risk any death um yeah thank you so much 
thanks so much uh next question is from
fundo thank you so much youu for your time I will 
I will I would like to ask the sorry I would like  
to ask the just two knowing that Defending Your 
most comfort table situation what happened during  
Avis H was an over pressure moment of something 
like that yeah I mean to give you guys context  
we just lost a double or triple overtime on ice 
box that we felt super confident in um and it  
took us like a lot of Defense to just get back 
into the protocols that we already established  
um in practice so um we lost the close one I can 
tell the nerves are a little high and then going  
into the next game um we try to mentally reset um 
and you just forget a few things and that's what  
happens so you forget if you forget what you need 
to do um you're not going to have those conditions  
that you that set up set you up to win and Lev 
is such a good team that they'll capitalize and  
they'll punish you for making those mistakes well 
thank you so very much thank you thank so much uh  
next question is from see yeah my question is for 
either uh Valen or Josh um l in their last icebox  
against Vitality looked very different than how 
they played against you today um how do you kind  
of I guess spread like what sorts of information 
you have in like last time you went up against  
them versus like what their last matches on 
certain Maps look like when you're preparing for a
team um I mean to be honest our game plan 
was mainly revolving around our stuff so  
we weren't really focused on their ice box too 
much cuz it's their favorite map they're going  
to have ways to switch it up it's a playoff of 
Champions We were already aware they were going  
to change how they play so we were very focused 
on our level of play try to make it perfect and  
be prepared for all of the you know adversity 
we're going to face so honestly I don't think  
it changed any of our preparation it wasn't more 
difficult it was just we just came very short
thank you so much uh we have question here in the
room I think that we have questions here so and 
also we do have more questions in for the Well  
from the media in the call so yeah okay uh thank 
you you two for being here and your determination  
SP are commendable so we look forward for you for 
your future matches thank you thank you thank you
